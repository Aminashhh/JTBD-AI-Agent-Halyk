Chairman of the Board’s 
Statement

13
Dear shareholders, clients and partners,
The year 2023 will be remembered for increasing geopolitical tension between East and West, 
slowing economic growth worldwide and disruptions in international logistics. Amid more muted 
economic activity in the main hydrocarbon-consuming countries, oil prices slumped by 17% year-on-
year.
Despite the impact of external macroeconomic and energy-related factors, the military action in 
Ukraine, disruptions in domestic oil production and a poor grain harvest, in 2023, Kazakhstan’s GDP 
increased by 5.1% year-on-year. This was considerably higher than the forecasts for both the world 
and the country by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In addition, the trend was 
positive in all key sectors, apart from agriculture: compared with 2022, construction expanded by 
13.3%, trade by 11.3%, IT and communications by 7.1%, transport by 6.9% and industry by 4.3%. The 
main drivers of this surge in activity were a recovery in domestic oil production in the fourth quarter, 
an injection into the economy of an additional KZT1.3 trillion by the National Fund and greater trade. 
Alongside this, by pursuing a tighter monetary policy, the National Bank of Kazakhstan succeeded in 
reducing the rate of inflation to 9.8%. Meanwhile, by   making injections from National Oil Fund, the 
government managed to increase investment in fixed assets by 13.7% year-on-year to US$39.5 
billion.
The development of Kazakhstan’s financial sector has slowed slightly and entered a more organic 
phase. However, this has not prevented Halyk Group from achieving its strategic objectives, 
progressing in developing its key business lines and expanding its presence in Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan and Georgia. Notably, amid rising risks associated with greater international sanctions and 
the threat that secondary sanctions could be imposed on Kazakh companies, the Bank made 
appropriate changes to its internal procedures and business processes for controlling payments and 
accounts of new clients, undertook a major restructuring of the entire compliance, and increased the 
headcount of the compliance and currency control departments. We believe that this approach will 
allow us to minimise the various threats to the Bank’s business and help to preserve its reputation in 
the eyes of the international investment community, rating agencies and external auditors.

Board’s Statement
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD’S STATEMENT

In 2023, Halyk Group’s net income climbed by 21.8% year-on-year to KZT693 billion, while its 
consolidated assets increased by 7.6% year-on-year to KZT15.5 trillion, driven by a rise in client funds 
and debt securities issued. Halyk Group continues to lead with a market share of 29% by assets, 
placing it well ahead of its closest peers. The loan portfolio accounts for around 60% of its total assets, 
standing at KZT9.3 trillion in 2023. In terms of loans to customers (on a net basis), the Group had a 
market share of 32.8%, making it the largest commercial bank lender to the national economy.
SMEs accounted for the most growth in the Group’s loan portfolio, at 25.1% year-on-year. This was 
due to our systematic work to implement Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s call to expand 
lending to the real sector as a key condition for accelerating economic growth in the country. The Bank 
is actively involved in all government programmes to support domestic business.
Loans to the Bank’s corporate clients grew by 13.4% year-on-year in 2023, reflecting the expectations 
of large businesses that slowing inflation and subsequent base rate cuts would reduce lending costs. 
The retail segment of the loan portfolio rose by 22.7% year-on-year.
As the partner of choice in Kazakhstan for most businesses and practically the only bank providing a 
full range of services, our focus is to maximise the digitalisation of banking services, improve the 
customer experience and expand the functionality of Onlinebank, our mobile app for corporate 
customers. Last year, we added new digital products and services to the range of services available 
through the app. Halyk Bank’s digital unsecured bid bonds were particularly popular, their number 
increasing by 3.7 times and their volume by 4.6 times in 2023. We also achieved impressive results in 
our transaction banking business, where the volume of transactions by corporate clients climbed by 
20% year-on-year to KZT109.5 trillion.
In 2024, the reputable information and analytical firm SME Banking Agency again rated the 
Onlinebank app highly for its growing popularity, extensive functionality and strong security, as well as 
the variety and accessibility of the services that it offers for entrepreneurs to manage their finances. 
The Business Mobile Banking 2024 rankings, which evaluated more than 130 specialised mobile 
apps, recognised Onlinebank as the leader among mobile banks for businesses in Kazakhstan. 
Onlinebank was honoured with a similarly high assessment in May 2022.
In parallel with our work to improve services for entrepreneurs, we are actively investing to expand the 
functionality of the Halyk Super-App for retail clients. Offering a wide range of financial and non-
financial services, it is one of the leading online banking platforms for retail customers in Kazakhstan. 
In 2023 alone, the number of its monthly active users (MAU) reached 7.9 million, up 46.2% year-on-
year, while the number of daily active users (DAU) rose by 34.9%.
This rapid growth in the Halyk Super-App’s popularity among Kazakh customers can be explained by 
our one-stop-shop approach to retail banking. We offer a full range of remote banking services within 
an integrated financial ecosystem, complemented by online insurance, brokerage services, the most 
popular government services and a variety of unique products designed for active lifestyle customers. 
These include the Kino.kz service for entertainment tickets, which has a market share of 37%; and the 
Halyk Travel service for air, rail and intercity bus tickets services, whose sales increased by 20% year-
on-year in 2023. In addition, on our Halyk Marketplaceplatform, the volume of purchases climbed by 
2.7 times.
Another unique innovation that Halyk Bank implemented through the Halyk Super-App is the kundelik.
kz that student receives bonuses for excellent marks, participants: students of grades 5-11. For each 
excellent mark, a student can receive 100 Halyk bonus points on a Halyk Easy bank card. In addition, 
more than 50 different online government services are available to Kazakh customers through the 
Halyk Super-App, more than any other commercial bank in the country. Overall, our clients have used 
government services through the Halyk Super-App more than 13 million times.
Given the favourable prospects for greater cooperation and closer trade relations with Uzbekistan, 
Halyk Group considers Kazakhstan’s neighbour a priority market in terms of its strategic development 
plans. Since establishing Tenge Bank there in 2019, it has invested more than US$100 million in its 
subsidiary’s charter capital. As of the end of 2023, the portfolio of loans provided from Halyk Bank’s 
balance sheet for major projects in Uzbekistan amounted to around US$690 million. Over the Group’s 
time in the market, Tenge Bank’s assets have increased to US$556 million. In 2023, assets rose by 
US$161.3 million, of which loans accounted for 83.9%. Such impressive results are due to an effective 
business model, which focuses on automating business processes, harnessing modern digital 
solutions and developing online service channels, with an emphasis on mobile banking and a full-
cycle e-commerce platform, Tenge Market.
Another key country in terms of Halyk Group’s geographic expansion is Georgia, where the subsidiary 
Halyk Bank Georgia has already been present for over 15 years. Given the rising trade volumes, active 
expansion of transit corridors, construction of logistics hubs and growing tourism between 
Kazakhstan and Georgia, the Group sees room to develop its business there further. In August 2023 
alone, it invested US$11 million in Halyk Bank Georgia. Underpinned by the Group’s commitment to the 
highest international standards, extensive experience, proven expertise and high ratings, this will help 
to drive business, adopt cutting-edge IT solutions and meet the growing needs of customers in the 
country’s highly competitive banking market. In 2023, Halyk Bank Georgia’s total assets increased to 
over US$336 million, equity reached US$88 million and net income soared by 40% year-on-year.

As part of the work to analyse the profitability of investments in neighbouring countries, following the 
divestment of the subsidiaries in Russia and Tajikistan, in 2023, Halyk Group decided to sell 100% of 
Halyk Bank Kyrgyzstan.
Halyk Group continues to play an active role in Kazakh society, helping the state and citizens to solve 
everyday issues. For example, in 2023, to support families of employees of a forestry enterprise who 
died while fighting a fire in the Abay region, we transferred KZT3 million to each and forgave any loans 
with Halyk Bank. In addition, we were closely involved with the national project Karyzsyz Kogam (Debt 
Free Society), which the Amanat political party proposed as a way of increasing financial literacy 
among the population. As the leading provider of commercial loans in the national economy, Halyk 
Bank sees a duty to create a rational consumer culture among local borrowers and encourage a 
responsible approach to taking and repaying loans. As financial literacy is particularly low in rural 
areas, Halyk Bank decided not only to sponsor this much-needed project, but also to send employees 
to educate entrepreneurs and residents in remote areas about money matters. Individual participants 
learned how to better manage their personal finances, optimise their income and expenses and 
protect against fraudsters, while new entrepreneurs learned about how to devise a company budget, 
prepare tax returns and harness the benefits of state subsidised lending programmes.
Other achievements by Halyk Group in 2023 include high recognition of Halyk Bank’s top 
management from reputable international experts. Notably, Umut Shayakhmetova, Chairperson of the 
Management Board, won awards from two independent organisations. International Banker, an 
established industry publication, named her “Banking CEO of the Year in Eastern Europe in 2023”, 
noting her contribution to developing the business in challenging macroeconomic conditions and 
maintaining a balance among pursuing rapid growth, ensuring risk management and keeping the 
quality of the loan portfolio high. In addition, the Yuksalish national movement and the Institute for 
Social and Economic Initiatives in Uzbekistan named her as one of the top 40 women leaders in 
Central Asia, highlighting her contributions to developing the region’s financial community, as well as 
business, education, sport and society.
Despite the challenges of 2023, the Halyk Group has once again demonstrated that even in complex 
economic and geopolitical conditions, a properly structured organisation with a well-established 
corporate governance system and professional management can continue to deliver tangible results 
through efficient teamwork. We are optimistic about the future and confident that the Halyk Group 
team is capable of achieving the ambitious goals set out in our current strategy. 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to Halyk 
Group’s shareholders, customers, partners and all our colleagues for their productive collaboration, 
understanding and support of our strategic vision.

Dear clients, partners and shareholders,
The core focus of 2023 for most public institutions and private organisations in Kazakhstan was to 
collectively overcome the challenges associated with rising global prices, the escalating military 
conflict between Russia and Ukraine, tightening international sanctions, heightened geopolitical 
tensions, global supply chain disruptions and a worldwide slowdown in economic growth.
In the year, the government and National Bank implemented numerous effective countermeasures 
that helped to mitigate the negative impact of these unfavourable factors on Kazakhstan’s economy. 
These included pursuing a tight monetary policy, boosting fixed capital investments to a record KZT18 
trillion, increasing domestic production, providing affordable financing for manufacturing projects, 
enacting anti-monopoly and foreign trade regulations, controlling pricing, and optimising logistics 
and retail trade.
These comprehensive efforts helped to reduce annual inflation in Kazakhstan to 9.8% and expand 
GDP by 5.1% in 2023. Amid the ongoing global economic slowdown, this encouraging outcome gives 
cause for cautious optimism. This is based, in particular, on the gradual easing of monetary conditions, 
reflecting the beginning of a slowdown in inflation, as well as a general increase in investment activity 
in the economy, greater business activity in almost all sectors and an acceleration in business lending. 
By the end of 2024, we expect inflation to be around 8.5%, the base rate to be reduced to 12% and 
Kazakhstan’s GDP growth to be 4-5%, based on various estimates.

In 2023, Kazakhstan’s banking sector again demonstrated its resilience and ability to quickly adapt to 
changes in the operating environment. These included strong inflationary pressures and a high cost 
of liquidity, increased regulatory oversight, a greater tax burden and tougher lending requirements, a 
significant escalation of geopolitical risks and multiple increase in compliance workload. At the year-
end, the banking sector’s aggregate net income was KZT2.2 trillion, up 50% compared with 2022. 
The increase in banks’ income, coupled with a fivefold slowdown in the growth of loan portfolio 
provisions, helped to increase the sector’s capitalisation by 31.3% to KZT6.9 trillion.
During the year, Halyk Bank reaffirmed its ability to achieve its goals in a rapidly changing 
macroeconomic environment, respond to new and more complex challenges, effectively manage 
risks and actively develop its business across all market segments. Thanks to the growth of customer 
funds and debt securities issued, the Bank’s assets increased by 7.6% in 2023 to KZT15.5 trillion as of 
1 January 2024. Around 63% of the bank’s assets are loans to customers, which rose by 18% (gross) 
in the reporting period, driven by an increase of 13.4% in the corporate segment, 25.1% in the SME 
portfolio and 22.7% in retail. Meanwhile, the amounts due to customers climbed by 4%. At the year-
end, the share of tenge-denominated corporate deposits was 72.9% (up 12.3 percentage points) and 
the share of retail tenge deposits was 63.4% (up 10.8 percentage points). 
Amid such strong growth in lending and transactional banking, the Bank delivered impressive financial 
results, including net income of KZT693.4 billion, up 21.8% year-on-year. This increase, in turn, drove 
the Bank’s equity capital up 23.1% to KZT2.477 trillion, enabling the Bank to absorb potential external 
shocks and develop its business confidently in the current volatile environment.
In addition to objective financial metrics, Halyk Bank’s high stability and growth prospects are evident 
in assessments from the international rating agencies Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s 
Investors Service. They affirmed the Bank’s ratings at their current high levels in 2023, noting among 
the Bank’s strengths its sufficient headroom , strong customer base and dominant position in the 
banking market, as well as its long history of profitability, solid capitalisation and ample liquidity buffer. 
Moody’s changed Halyk Bank’s outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘positive’, reflecting expectations that the 
improvement seen in the operating environment will allow the Bank to grow without taking increased 
risks, reduce the volatility of its funding base and improve key credit metrics. In addition, in March 
2024, after the reporting period, Standard & Poor’s revised its outlook on Halyk Bank from ‘stable’ to 
‘positive’, affirmed the bank’s ‘BB+/B’ international scale ratings and improved its national scale 
ratings from ‘kzAA’ to ‘kzAA+’.
Over the past few years, a core driver underpinning the success of Halyk Bank’s business has been its 
holistic approach to customer service, as well as its transition from a traditional banking model to an 
integrated ecosystem of fintech services. Seeking to integrate its extensive customer base of over 10 
million retail clients into the digital ecosystem, the Bank is investing significant resources to develop 
state-of-the-art software solutions and is constantly expanding the range of products, services and 
facilities available through its mobile apps for retail and corporate customers.
By integrating the Bank’s IT systems with the databases of government bodies, Halyk’s mobile app 
now serves as a one-stop shop. Customers can access more than 6,000 commission-free payments, 
52 different government services and a wide range of online offerings, including lending, deposits, 
money transfers, insurance, securities investments and instalment purchases.
Through its holistic service approach and access to government databases, the Bank can offer 
customers personalised service packages linked to important life events, such as marriage and 
childbirth, thereby increasing the engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of the customer base. This is 
driving the popularity of the Halyk Super App. In 2023, the number of unique monthly users of the 
service soared to 7.9 million, up 46.2% year-on-year, while the number of such daily users reached 2.3 
million, up 34.9%. 
The Bank’s emphasis on introducing modern digital technologies and offering products that 
anticipate market needs is complemented by its traditional charitable activities well. During its 100th 
year of operations, Halyk Bank organised its traditional 100 Good Deeds charity marathon. As part of 
this initiative, it implemented major social projects in the fields of education, culture, healthcare and 
environmental protection. Together with Halyk Fund, a subsidiary that focuses on charity, it allocated 
KZT4.0 billion towards sponsorship and charitable assistance during 2023.
The Bank also supported mass sport activities, including its traditional free ice-skating events for all 
comers in all regions of the country. As part of the People’s League social project, it financed training 
sessions, the purchase of sportswear and sports equipment, and the organisation of the Cup of Hope 
championship for children from orphanages and sponsored organisations. In addition, the Bank acted 
as a general partner of the Astana Half Marathon 2023, a massive race in the capital. More than 2,000 
people, including 100 employees, ran in the marathon.

Halyk Bank also supported several cultural projects, including the celebration of Nauryz, by setting up 
themed yurts in all regions of Kazakhstan. It also sponsored the revival of the iconic Asia Dauysy 
(Voice of Asia) music festival, as well as the organisation of the open-air “Summer Music in Your 
Favourite City” classical music festivals in Almaty, Aktau, Semey and Aktobe.
Among the important social initiatives implemented with the direct assistance of the Bank are the 
unique Karyzsyz Kogam (Debt Free Society) project, implemented together with the Amanat party 
with the aim of teaching financial literacy to 65,000 village residents; the connection to gas networks 
of private homes of socially vulnerable residents in Almaty and Astana; a charity event for World War 
II veterans; and the donation of vehicles adapted for people with special needs to regional societies 
that support people with disabilities in 13 Kazakh cities. As part of its environmental protection efforts, 
the Bank joined the UN in support of ecological projects by local artists and designers and helped to 
organise the “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” event, intended to raise awareness of environmental issues 
among communities in Kazakhstan.
For the country’s youngest citizens, the Bank organised a children’s drawing competition to mark 
Child Protection Day. It also provided assistance to first graders from low-income and large families as 
part of the Road to School project and supported the construction of children’s sport and playgrounds 
in seven regions of Kazakhstan.
For us, the Bank’s 100th anniversary is an occasion to look back at our achievements and review 
important lessons learned. We look to the future with cautious optimism, making plans based on a 
thorough analysis of the macroeconomic and geopolitical situation, considering all possible risks and 
exploring the most likely scenarios. This approach has laid the foundation for the Bank’s new medium-
term strategy covering 2025-27. It is already clear that the Bank and Halyk Group will continue to 
deepen its digitalisation and customer focus while introducing new products, not only in banking but 
also in non-banking areas, to expand our multifunctional ecosystem. Our most important goal remains 
unchanged: to maintain the financial stability, leading positions and strong performance of both the 
Bank and Halyk Group as a whole.

Following moderate growth in 2022, the Kazakh economy picked up considerably in the last quarter 
of 2023, and GDP growth for the year reached 5.1%. The increased business activity in 2023 was 
driven by an unplanned injection by the National Fund of an additional KZT1.3 trillion in funds into the 
economy, a recovery in oil production and a simultaneous rise in trade. In addition, the low base of the 
previous year’s GDP growth, of just 3.2%, played a substantial role in the economy achieving record 
growth since 2013.
The external economic conditions were exacerbated by geopolitical instability and high interest rates 
of central banks in various key countries. The global economy slowed once again, which had a 
noticeable impact on the hydrocarbon market, where oil prices dropped by 17% year-on-year in 2023. 
As a result, trade conditions for Kazakhstan were significantly worse, which caused an export deficit. 
The pace of the country’s accelerated economic growth was constrained somewhat by internal 
problems with the economy, including an energy crisis (rising prices for fuel and lubricants and 
disruptions in the country’s energy system) and a poor harvest.
In 2023, substantial transfers from the National Fund played a decisive role in boosting fixed 
investment, which increased by 13.7% year-on-year overall. Economic growth was also driven by a 
rise in fixed investment to US$39.5 billion in dollar terms, the second highest in the country’s history, 
after the previous record of US$39.9 billion in 2013. Also noteworthy were the contributors to the 
investment boom in Kazakhstan last year. Whereas in the past the oil sector largely dictated 
investment activity, in 2023, investments in public utilities and transport infrastructure became the 
main drivers, with budgetary allocations also playing a major role.

In 2023, foreign direct investment slumped, partly due to higher borrowing costs on capital markets. 
Factoring in the amount of reinvested profit, Kazakhstan once again experienced a negative net 
capital inflow, a trend seen consistently since 2018.
For several years, the state’s pricing policy has been based on keeping tariffs low, despite them not 
covering the costs of state monopolies, which has led to a deterioration in infrastructure. As a result, 
the state has had to quickly mobilise resources for major infrastructure modernisation. This, in turn, 
will support related investments in the coming years while tariffs are raised to levels closer to actual 
market ones. However, demand for bank loans remains insufficient. In 2023, the share of loans in 
investments declined from 3.2% to 2.5%.
Despite collapsing in August, the tenge strengthened in 2023, for the first time since 2017, amid a 
greater supply of currency from the National Fund. The national currency’s appreciation by the year-
end was also helped by the ruble strengthening against the US dollar. However, the exchange rates of 
the US dollar against the ruble and tenge nevertheless moved in different proportions, which 
bolstered the tenge’s position against the Russian currency. The tenge appreciation also had a 
positive effect on inflation, which fell to single digits. Together, these factors, along with the budgetary 
funds pumped into the economy, fuelled domestic demand and stimulated corporate investment and 
household consumption.
While revenues from oil sales declined in 2023, the oil sector contributed substantially to 
Kazakhstan’s overall economic growth amid an increase in hydrocarbon production. We estimate that 
the oil sector’s contribution to GDP growth was around 0.5 percentage points. However, national oil 
production has been steadily declining since 2019, which has noticeably reduced the total output. In 
these conditions, the non-oil sectors have been saved by continuous injections from the National 
Fund, which have averaged more than US$10 billion a year since 2020.

Kazakhstan set a new demographic record in 2023, as its population passed the landmark of 20 
million people at the year-end. On average, the figure is rising by one million each year. Population 
growth naturally contributes to greater economic activity, as it increases the labour supply and 
domestic demand. After declining in the 1990s, the country’s population stabilised only in the early 
2000s, before gradually beginning to increase and reaching pre-crisis levels around 2010.
Amid stable external demand and the overall recovery of the Kazakh economy, industrial output 
increased by 4.3% year-on-year in 2023, compared with 1.1% in 2022. The main drivers were the 
mining sector (+4.6% year-on-year) and the manufacturing industry (+4.1%).
The National Bank of Kazakhstan reports that the current account balance had a deficit of US$8.7 
billion in 2023, the highest since 2020. The main factor impacting the current account was a 
significant increase in imports of goods and services, which have been rising for three years in a row. 
Given the drop in oil prices of almost 20%, along with an increase in oil production of almost 7%, 
exports declined by 3.6% year-on-year in 2023. As a result, the foreign trade surplus plummeted by 
almost 50% to less than US$19 billion.
The negative current account balance is almost US$9 billion and amounts to -3.3% of GDP in relative 
terms.
The rise in imports was driven by the unbridled increase in government spending, as well as the 
strengthening tenge, which benefited from the flow of foreign currency from the National Fund. 
Double-digit growth was also seen in consumer lending, which the population taps to compensate for 
falling incomes amid high inflation and which also increases demand for imported products.

Consumption trends are largely moving with those of retail trade: retail sales amounted to KZT19.2 
trillion in 2023, up 14% compared with 2022. In real terms, trade turnover rose by 7.7% year-on-year, 
which significantly outpaced GDP growth for 2023. This was entirely due to greater turnover of non-
food products.

Despite dropping slightly in the year, tax revenues increased by 27% overall in 2023, which was lower 
than the record in 2022, but significantly higher than in the previous five years. Compared with GDP, 
tax revenues in real terms have also been notable for higher growth in the post-COVID period. 
However, a disparity was seen last year, as GDP growth did not fully result in greater tax revenues, 
although real growth remained at double-digit levels. Structurally, the non-oil sector accounted for the 
bulk of GDP growth last year, while the oil sector suffered amid lower hydrocarbon prices, although 
this was offset by tenge appreciation. Agricultural output also decreased because of poor harvests. As 
such, the shortfall in taxes was due to the oil component.

The state budget deficit once again surged in 2023, rising by almost 30% to a three-year high of 
KZT2.8 trillion. This stemmed partly from the rapid increase in expenditures, while revenues came 
under pressure.
In 2023, inflation amounted to 9.8%, marking the first single-digit figure since February 2022. 
Inflation continued to gradually stabilise in the year, due to both favourable external factors and 
domestic state policy. First, the tenge appreciated several times in 2023 and amounted to KZT456.31/
US$1 by the year-end, which is even lower than the annual rate for 2022. Second, the monetary 
regulator adhered to a very tight monetary policy throughout the year, starting an easing cycle only in 
the second half and reducing the base interest rate very conservatively – by one percentage point by 
the year-end. Third, as noted, inflationary pressure declined around the world, largely due to lower 
energy and food prices and austere measures taken by central banks.
At the same time, inflation could have been even lower if not for the fiscal stimulus measures taken by 
the government, which funded the country’s ever-growing expenses from the National Fund 
throughout 2023.

Transfers from the National Fund to the state budget equalled KZT4 trillion, down KZT0.6 trillion 
compared with 2022. However, additional withdrawals from the National Fund amounted to KZT1.3 
trillion, which were essentially the same as transfers, meaning that total transfers amounted to KZT5.3 
trillion.
The share of transfers in overall government revenues has been declining since 2020, reflecting the 
significant growth in tax revenues. By the end of 2023, it had dropped to 16%, a new record low, 
except for the very first year of transfers in 2007, when they amounted to just 9% of budget revenues.
In 2023, state budget expenditures increased to KZT26.8 trillion, up more than KZT5 trillion (+24.3% 
year-on-year).
Despite the relatively modest growth in spending on education, healthcare and social security, the 
social sector continued to account for more than half of all budget expenditures.

National Bank monetary policy
In the second half of 2023, the National Bank of Kazakhstan began to gradually soften its monetary 
policy, reducing the base interest rate from 16.75% to 15.75% by the year-end. At the same time, 
consumer inflation slowed significantly, from 20.3% year-on-year in December 2022 to 9.8% in 
December 2023.
All components of aggregate demand demonstrated double-digit growth rates, including retail trade, 
loans for household consumer purposes, fixed investment and state budget expenditures, which 
created upward inflationary pressure on the economy last year.
Overall, inflation in the country is gradually stabilising as the economy adapts to external shocks and 
inflation normalises worldwide. The tenge appreciation also played an important role in this process, 
as the exchange rate began to strengthen for the first time since 2017 and amounted to KZT456.31/
US$1 on average for the year (compared with KZT460.5 in 2022).
Banking sector of Kazakhstan
In 2023, the loan portfolio of second-tier banks increased to KZT27.9 trillion, up 22.4% year-on-year, 
a growth rate slightly lower than in 2022 (+23.3% year-on-year). This was mainly due to expansion in 
the retail loan portfolio, which increased by 28.9% year-on-year in 2023 (+31.8% in 2022) and 
amounted to KZT18.2 trillion, almost twice that of the corporate loan portfolio (KZT9.7 trillion). The 
corporate loan portfolio grew by 11.9% year-on-year in 2023 (+11.5% in 2022). The share of the 
corporate portfolio in the overall loan portfolio of commercial banks decreased to 34.7% (37.9% in 
2022). Growth in the loan portfolio was mainly due to a 23.0% year-on-year increase in loans 
denominated in local currency (+26.4% in 2022), while lending in foreign currency rose by 16.3% 
year-on-year (-3.1% in 2022). The share of loans denominated in local currency remains several times 
higher than that of foreign currency: 92.3% and 7.7%, respectively (compared with 91.9% and 8.1% in 
2022).
Consumer lending continues to dominate in the retail loan portfolio both in terms of growth rates and 
volume: in 2023, the consumer loan portfolio grew by 34.1% year-on-year (+25.2% in 2022) and 
amounted to KZT10.3 trillion (KZT7.7 trillion in 2022). The share of consumer loans in the overall loan 
portfolio of second-tier banks increased over the year and amounted to 37.0% at the end of 2023 
(33.7% in 2022). Lending for the construction and purchase of housing by the population increased 
by 17.8% year-on-year in 2023 to KZT5.5 trillion (KZT4.7 trillion in 2022). As a result, over the year, the 
share of such lending decreased slightly to 19.9%, from 20.6% in 2022.
The share of loans overdue for more than 90 days (NPL90+) declined from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.9% in 
2023. In nominal terms, the NPL90+ figure was up 6% year-on-year, from KZT814.6 billion in 2022 to 
KZT863.8 billion in 2023.
In 2023, the deposit portfolio of banks increased by 12.0% year-on-year (+14.2% in 2022) to KZT34.7 
trillion (KZT30.9 trillion in 2022). The rise was mainly driven by a 20.4% increase in retail deposits 
(+18.0% in 2022) to KZT18.8 trillion (KZT15.6 trillion in 2022), while corporate deposits grew by 3.5% 
year-on-year KZT15.8 trillion (KZT15.3 trillion in 2022). Broken down by currency, tenge deposits 
increased by 25.8% year-on-year to KZT21.2 trillion, while foreign currency deposits dropped by 
17.7% year-on-year to KZT8.1 trillion (KZT9.8 trillion in 2022). In 2023, dollarisation in Kazakhstan 
decreased to 23.2% (31.6% in 2022), its lowest since 1997.
As of the year-end, total liquidity withdrawn by the National Bank of Kazakhstan was up 18.3% year-
on-year at KZT4.4 trillion. The main instrument that it used to withdraw funds was the deposit auction, 
at which total transactions increased by 157.2% year-on-year to KZT2.5 trillion. Withdrawals through 
deposits grew by 17.1% year-on-year to KZT1.0 trillion, while withdrawals through short-term notes 
dropped by 46.3% to KZT1.2 trillion . Overall, at the year-end, the volume of sterilised liquidity was 
11.6% of the money supply (10.9% in 2022) and 14.9% of the gross loans (15.5% in 2022) of second-
tier banks.
In 2023, commercial banks generated total profits of KZT2.2 trillion, up 49.0% from 2022. Net 
interest income in the banking sector grew by 31.2% year-on-year to KZT2.7 trillion, while net fee and 
commission income amounted to KZT727 billion (+20.5%). Provision recovery income increased by 
25.9% year-on-year to KZT1.6 trillion. The return on assets of banks rose from 3.6% in 2022 to 4.6% 
in 2023, while the capital of second-tier banks increased by 31.3% year-on-year to KZT6.9 trillion 
(+15.3% in 2022).

Net profit attributable to common shareholders rose to KZT693.4 billion in 2023, up 21.8% compared 
with KZT569.5 billion in 2022. This was due mainly to a significant increase in the lending and 
transactional businesses, despite a one-off negative impact from the accelerated amortisation of a 
discount (net of tax effect) in the amount) of KZT24.8 billion on a deposit of the Kazakhstan 
Sustainability Fund (KSF), which the Bank partly prepaid in December 2023 (a partial prepayment of 
state support received by Kazkommertsbank as a deposit from the KSF in 2015). 
Interest income climbed by 33.8% year-on-year, due mainly to an increase in the average rate and 
balances of loans to customers.
The interest expense rose by 48.6% compared with 2022. This was driven mainly by a higher average 
rate on amounts due to customers and share of tenge amounts due to customers, as well as a one-off 
negative impact from the abovementioned accelerated amortisation of a discount of KZT24.8 billion 
on the KSF deposit. Consequently, net interest income climbed by 21.1% year-on-year. 
In 2023, the net interest margin was affected by the increase in average rates on both loans to 
customers and amounts due to customers following a rise in market interest rates. Furthermore, the 
share of loans to customers in total interest-earning assets soared. Meanwhile, there was an increase 
in the average rate of FX amounts due from credit institutions and FX interest-earning cash and cash 
equivalents following a global rise in US dollar interest rates. As a result, the net interest margin 
climbed to 6.2% in 2023, compared with 5.6% in 2022.
Moreover, the net interest margin in 2023 and the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the 
abovementioned accelerated amortisation of the discount of KZT24.8 billion on the KSF deposit. 
Excluding this effect, the net interest margin would have amounted to 6.5% in 2023 and 7.0% for the 
fourth quarter.
In 2023, the overall year-on-year dynamics of the fee and commission income and expense was 
driven by growth in the number of clients and in clients’ transactional activity. Net fee and commission 
income increased by 19.5% year-on-year, due to a rise in net transactional income of both legal 
entities and individuals*, as well as in fees on letters of credit and guarantees issued.
Net fee and commission income for the fourth quarter decreased by 20.3% compared with the same 
period of 2022. This was due to higher expenses on loyalty programme bonuses and deposit 
insurance fees payable to the Kazakhstan Deposit Insurance Fund. 
In 2023, other non-interest income(4) decreased by 17.3% year-on-year. This was due mainly to a 
lower net foreign-exchange gain amid higher volatility of exchange rates and interest rates in 2022.
Net insurance income(5) surged by 89.2% compared with 2022, due to growth in the life and general 
insurance business.
Operating expenses increased by 14.5% year-on-year. This was due mainly to the indexation of 
salaries and other employee benefits from 1 March 2023, as well a rise in IT investments and expenses 
for development of the card business. As part of operating expenses for 2023, the cost of audit 
services amounted to KZT506.2 million (in 2022 – KZT467.5 million).
In 2023, the cost of risk on loans to customers remained at normalized level and within the scope of 
our full-year guidance, at 1.0%. 
The cost-to-income ratio equalled 19.2%, compared with 19.0% in 2022, the slight difference being 
due to higher operating expenses.
As at the end of 2023, total assets were up 7.6% year-to-date, driven by an increase in amounts due 
to customers and debt securities issued.
Compared with the end of 2022, loans to customers were up 18.0% on a gross and 18.2% on a net 
basis. The growth in the gross loan portfolio was attributable to a rise of 13.4% in corporate, 25.1% in 
SME and 22.7% in retail loans. 
Despite some increase in absolute terms, Stage 3 loans had decreased to 7.5% by the year-end, due 
to loan portfolio growth.
Compared with the end of the third quarter, deposits of legal entities and deposits of individuals were 
up 11.2% and 9.3%, respectively, driven by client fund inflows. 
As at the year-end, the share of tenge deposits in total corporate deposits was 72.9%, compared with 
60.6% at the end of 2022, while the share in total retail deposits was 63.4%, compared with 52.6% a 
year earlier.

Halyk Bank’s core business focuses on retail, corporate and SME banking. Through 
subsidiaries, the Bank also provides insurance, cash collection, asset management, brokerage, 
telecommunication and leasing services.
Retail banking
In 2023, the retail business once again delivered solid results. The retail team continued to actively 
work on digitalisation, developing new products and building financial and consumer ecosystem 
services. The Bank’s digital strategy has received positive feedback from the consumer market. 
Despite intense competition from second-tier banks, there was strong demand throughout the year 
for the Bank’s retail products. The Bank incorporated feedback from its customers, relentlessly 
improving the quality of its services. The Bank’s ratings continue to improve and are still among the 
best on the market. Customer trust has always been and remains one of the main criteria that the Bank 
uses to measure its success. Halyk Group values this trust and makes every effort to not only maintain 
it, but also enhance it. Another area of focus is on processes related to system security, an important 
consideration in the current environment for customers choosing to begin or continue working with 
the Bank.
Halyk Bank maintained its leading position in deposits, with a market share of 27.4%. At the year-end, 
its deposit portfolio amounted to KZT5.8 trillion. Opening deposits online remains a popular service 
among the Bank’s customers and accounted for 78% of new deposits in 2023.
In Halyk Bank’s card business, the positive trend continued. As of 1 January 2024, the Bank had 7 
million active payment cards issued and remained a leader in this area, with a market share of 20%.
To expand the payment card service, the Bank continued to equip branches with self-embossers, 
which allow customers to receive payment cards with the assistance of a manager. In 2023, 52 
additional self-embossers were installed in the branch network. The Bank plans to deploy more of 
them in 2024. 
In November 2023, the Bank joined the National Payment Corporation of the National Bank of 
Kazakhstan in the Digital Tenge pilot project, part of the Programme for the Development of the 
National Payment System in Kazakhstan. During the pilot period, the Bank made such transactions 
available as cash withdrawals from cashpoints, payments through the POS terminal of the Bank and 
other second-tier banks, and online payments at retail and service outlets. The pilot project aims to 
further develop and modernise the National Payment System, in which the Bank plans to continue 
playing an active role.
The Bank has around 33,200 payroll card programmes, a key strategic service used to pay salaries on 
its cards to 2.9 million people, or 42% of the country’s working population. 
To foster and improve study skills, as well as offer social support for children of the Bank’s customers, 
in September 2023, it launched a new service called Kundelik. This electronic diary for schoolchildren 
in years 5-11 allows them to earn bonus points in the Halyk app for excellent marks (10 points is equal 
to 100 bonus points). The bonus points are awarded in a journal at http://kundelik.kz/ on the 
subsequent working day after a student receives an excellent mark. Since the start of the school year, 
the project has opened more than 580,000 Halyk Easy cards, digital children’s cards issued through 
the parent’s mobile app. At the year-end, the share of digital cards in the portfolio was 93%. This 
project encompasses 5,650 schools, or 73% of the schools in the country.
For the convenience of customers, the Bank was first to market with its launch of Face Pay, an 
innovative service that allows people to use their facial biometrics to pay for public transport such as 
the underground. Face Pay is a convenient, safe and fast way to pay for travel, which does not require 
a card or smartphone. Harnessing artificial intelligence, the payment process though Face Pay 
terminals takes only a few seconds, which is crucial for customers taking the underground during rush 
hour. In December, the Bank launched a pilot project for its customers at two underground stations in 
Almaty: Abay and Bauyrjan Momyshuly.
As of the end of 2023, around 2.5 million pensioners and beneficiaries continued to trust the Bank and 
use all its services. 
Lending remains the most actively growing business and a driver for the retail unit. As of 1 January 
2024, the Bank’s retail portfolio amounted to KZT3 trillion, representing a market share of 17.9%. In 
2023, the portfolio expanded by 19%. Online loans accounted for 84% of those issued in the year. 
A new project launched in September 2023 – digital car loans through partner dealerships – proved 
to be the breakthrough of the year. The project was implemented in partnership with the country’s 
leading car dealers, which are also corporate clients of the Bank. This initiative demonstrates the 
strong synergy between the Bank’s retail and corporate businesses, driving a 150% year-on-year 
increase in auto loans provided by the Bank. The process is simple: an application for a car loan is 
submitted through a car dealership, the bank loan and collateral agreements are signed using a mobile 
app, and the loan is issued online without needing to speak with a Bank manager or credit 
administrator, which makes customers happy. In December, the Bank saw excellent results in terms of 
the number of loans issued and had a 24.4% market share of overall car loans in Kazakhstan.
The Bank recently created an advanced analytics team to conduct in-depth data analysis, assess the 
probability of events and possible risks, predict trends, plan appropriately and take informed 
decisions. In solving advanced analytics problems, the Bank relies on the experience of a team of 
business analysts and data scientists, employing the most appropriate analytical methods, 
technologies and software for each task.

The team specialises in collecting, processing and interpreting large amounts of data-driven insights 
based on customers’ use of products and services. It applies this information to create machine 
learning models and launch marketing campaigns, which ultimately helps to provide the best offers 
and customer service. The models segment the customer base, which helps to better understand 
their needs, behaviour and market, as well as optimise the pricing of products and services.
In advanced analytics, statistical methods and machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms 
are applied to identify patterns and trends in data. Data visualisation creates interactive dashboards 
that help business units to better understand and use the findings.
GovTech: the digitalisation of public services 
GovTech continues to be a strategic focus for the Bank. Its main objectives are to make public services 
part of the Bank’s applications, integrate public services to automate the Bank’s internal business 
processes and liaise with government agencies regarding digitalisation issues. 
Since the creation of GovTech, the Bank has launched 52 public services. It continues to lead this 
sector among second-tier banks that facilitate public services. The services are highly popular among 
the Bank’s customers and had been used more than 13 million times as of the end of 2023. The most 
popular ones are digital documents, vehicle certification, verification of health insurance status and 
numerous types of enquiries/information. Some were presented at major IT forums, such as Digital 
Bridge and Digital Almaty, and to senior government officials, including the Kazakh president. When 
working with government agencies, the Bank has proven itself as a reliable, high-tech partner, and the 
Bank’s representatives are the first ones people to turn to when planning new initiatives.
In 2024, the Bank plans to further develop this focus and launch services that are in high demand 
among customers. 
Marketplace
Over the past two years, Halyk has launched products and services across verticals of the ecosystem 
that make life easier for and meet the needs of customers. The main focus remains on improving the 
Halyk Super App, which is the backbone of its retail offering and of which Halyk Marketplace is part. 
The Marketplace allows customers to buy goods from partners using Halyk Bank’s most 
advantageous financial products. Considering the rapid pace of digitalisation, changes in consumer 
behaviour and preferences, and the growing needs of customers, the Bank has combined these 
processes to offer every customer convenience, speed, simplicity and security. Each solution 
integrates big data analysis and aims to develop technological platforms. 
The Bank’s customers actively use the Marketplace and pay for purchases from trading partners by 
instalment or on credit, both through points of sale and online. 
In 2023, the Bank achieved its goal of making it possible for people to order goods directly from China 
and Turkey through cooperation with goods manufacturers in these countries. This is a unique 
offering on the market and has had a beneficial effect on several key metrics.
Specifically, in 2023, Halyk Market’s GMV surged by 170% year-on-year. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 
Halyk Market’s GMV jumped by a record KZT34.1 billion, an increase of 330% year-on-year. This 
considerable growth made possible through active marketing, increasing the product base to more 
than 874,000 SKUs, involving more major retailers and expanding the range of goods sold by existing 
partners. New banking products were also launched, such as loans with individual interest rates, 
which also made it possible to provide more competitive rates for Marketplace partners.
SME banking*
Halyk Bank has been and remains the leader in working with SMEs, in terms of both transactions and 
lending. As of 1 January 2024, the Bank serviced around 270,200 active SME clients, including over 
38,600 borrowers, who were provided with more than 75,100 loans in 2023. Deposits and balances 
on the current accounts of SME customers increased by 19% year-on-year, which demonstrates the 
high level of trust that customers have in Halyk Bank.
In 2023, the Bank expanded the list of services offered on the Onlinebank mobile app for legal entities, 
which boosted the popularity of the app among entrepreneurs and led to an increase in the number of 
MAUs. The Bank also worked actively to improve the system for working with Onlinebank legal entities 
and modified the design of the mobile app for business customers, which resulted in a significant 
increase in the DAU to MAU ratio from 27.0% to 30.9%.
Meanwhile, the development of a digital offering for legal entities helped to increase payments 
through Onlinebank, which grew by 20.3% to KZT109.5 trillion in 2023. This figure has more than 
doubled over the past two years.
In 2023, the SME digital team continued to actively increase lending to legal entities registered as

Corporate banking*
Corporate banking remains a key focus of Halyk Bank’s business, as it promotes the growth and 
development of the country’s largest companies.
The Bank is actively involved in financing various projects, including the development of social 
infrastructure, as well as educational and renewable energy projects. The Bank’s customers are 
among the country’s largest taxpayers and account for more than half of all budget revenues; 84% of 
the country’s largest taxpayers are its customers.
Halyk Bank continues to offer significant advantages, such as high limits for a group of borrowers and 
substantial liquidity in tenge and foreign currency, which enables the Bank to take part in financing 
major projects, including infrastructure. It also supports the development of Kazakh companies in 
international markets, including successful financing for joint projects in Uzbekistan.
In 2023, the corporate loan portfolio increased by KZT595 billion, or 13.4%. Through its relatively 
conservative approach to risk assessment, the Bank also retains one of the most stable portfolios on 
the market.
Halyk Bank offers high-quality customer service, as well as a wide range of products, services and 
tools to meet customer needs. Despite the steady growth in the number of corporate customers 
served, the average number of products that each transactional customer uses remains high, at 4.59, 
and is even higher for corporate borrowers, at 5.89. 
The main products provided to corporate customers include lending, trade finance and document 
operations, corporate cash settlement services, payroll card programmes and merchant acquiring 
solutions. The Bank also offers the full suite of Halyk Group services, including all types of insurance, 
brokerage, cash collection and other solutions.
One of the key components of the Bank’s corporate business is the active introduction of information 
technologies. Businesses strive to use modern data analytics and digital technologies to improve the 
efficiency of their business processes. This not only reduces costs, but also improves service quality. 
Transaction analysis, integration with government databases and client analytics helped to introduce 
a digital process for setting unsecured credit limits of up to KZT1 billion and issuing bank guarantees 
online, and also optimised the process of analysing large projects.
The Bank has introduced an online loan issuance process that allows the agreement to be signed 
electronically, so paper documents are not needed. This has been well received by corporate 
customers, who arranged more than 95% of loans online in 2023. 
Corporate lending, which accounts for the majority of the Bank’s loan portfolio, continues to occupy a 
leading position in the business. The Bank offers customers various types of corporate lending 
products, including secured and unsecured loans, as well as loans to finance investments and 
operations, factoring and other types of lending.
Factoring has become an essential digital product for the Bank, making it possible to quickly provide 
financial support to corporate customers. During the reporting period, the Bank expanded its range of 
factoring services, offering customers the opportunity to effectively manage their accounts 
receivable. The product not only helps to increase customer liquidity, but also reduces risks 
associated with the failure to pay bills.
Halyk Bank remains actively involved in a state programme to support large enterprises, which is 
being implemented through the Development Bank of Kazakhstan. Overall, the Bank has allocated 
KZT36.8 billion for this programme. In 2023, using resources provided by the National Fund, it 
financed major manufacturers in the pharmaceutical, chemical, textile and food industries, as well as 
producers of oil and gas equipment, construction materials, lubricants and cardboard. 
For the corporate banking business, 2023 was a successful year. The Bank implemented several 
major projects to finance such sectors of the economy as chemicals, energy, automotive, food 
production and oil, among others, using its strong liquidity and capital reserves, as well as its ability to 
offer customers a wide range of services through an extensive regional network. These results 
reaffirm the sustainability of the Bank’s corporate lending approaches.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Halyk Group’s risk management policy focuses on creating an integrated risk management system in 
line with the scope and scale of the Group’s activity and accepted risk profile, as well as supporting its 
business development requirements. The Group seeks to continuously develop its risk management 
system and improve the way in which it identifies, manages, assesses and controls risks.
1. RISK APPETITE MANAGEMENT
Halyk Bank’s risk appetite strategy defines clear boundaries for the acceptable volume of significant 
risks associated with the activities that the Bank undertakes while implementing Halyk Group’s 
Development Strategy. It also defines the risk profile of the Bank’s operations to prevent risks or 
minimise their negative impact on the Bank’s financial position. 
The approaches to risk appetite management are regulated by the risk appetite strategy, which has 
been approved by the Board of Directors. 
Risk appetite covers the aggregate level of material risks that the Bank is willing to accept or intends 
to exclude when implementing its strategy. 
The risk appetite strategy comprises general approaches to risk appetite management. This includes 
the policies, processes, controls and systems through which risk appetite is defined, monitored and 
distributed at all levels of the Bank’s organisational structure. 
As part of the risk appetite strategy, the Board of Directors has approved a set of quantitative risk 
appetite metrics for each significant risk level. These take into account the Bank’s established 
business model, as well as the scale, types and complexity of its operations. Compliance with the risk 
appetite levels is monitored periodically as part of management reporting on risks.
2. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 
To ensure effective credit risk management, the Bank has implemented a risk management system 
and business processes to segregate the sales and risk management functions. It has also created an 
organisational structure that facilitates credit risk management, including collegiate bodies and 
subdivisions that take part in the credit risk assessment and management process. 
The Bank manages credit risk by:
○ Adhering to the ‘three lines of defence’ principle: namely, initial analysis of credit risk by the initiating 
subdivision, analysis by the risk management function, and control by the internal audit function 
○ Setting counterparty limits depending on the type of (credit) transactions or products 
○ Diversifying the loan portfolio to mitigate a concentration of risk related to any one borrower, sector 
or geographical region 
○ Monitoring the loan portfolio to identify any deterioration in quality at an early stage 
○ Maintaining adequate provisioning to cover potential losses
Halyk Bank has developed and approved a Risk Appetite Strategy, which defines clear boundaries for 
the scope of the material risks that it has accepted and with which the Bank operates as part of the 
implementation of Halyk Group’s Development Strategy. The strategy also defines the risk profile of 
the Bank’s operations in order to prevent risks or minimise their negative impact on its financial 
position. When drafting and introducing the Risk Appetite Strategy for each significant level of risk, the 
Board of Directors approved the levels of risk appetite (for credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and 
risk), taking into account the business model it has adopted, the scale of its operations, as well as the 
types and complexity of its operations.

The Bank’s lending decision system is based on the delegation of certain powers by the Board of 
Directors to appropriate collegiate bodies and the establishment of credit limits for each body. For 
corporate borrowers, loan applications are reviewed by the Commercial Directorate. Loan 
applications that exceed the limits set for the Commercial Directorate, as well as transactions with 
related parties, require further approval by the Board of Directors. For SME borrowers, lending powers 
are delegated to the SME Centre for Decision-Making and Credit Committee of the branch network. 
Retail banking decisions are delegated to the Centre for Decision-Making and the Retail Credit 
Committee (RCC) of the Head Office. Credit decisions on conventional unsecured retail applications 
are taken using a specialised software module, which includes automated underwriting, the 
verification of internal and external databases and the scoring of applicants, among other things. 
Unconventional unsecured applications are subject to the credit approval procedure through the 
Centre for Decision-Making/RCC. Decisions on conventional unsecured/secured loan applications 
submitted by individual entrepreneurs and SME legal entities for the replenishment of their working 
capital and business development are taken as part of the digital credit decision-making process 
using risk models that assess the applicant’s creditworthiness and solvency, interest rate and lending 
limit based on internal and external data. Digital credit products (DCP) are reviewed and issued online 
for SME clients.
Credit committees of subsidiary banks are also authorised to take lending decisions within specific 
limits. The Bank regularly monitors and, if necessary or if covenant thresholds are exceeded, revises 
independent decision-making limits and the authority matrices of the credit committees at subsidiary 
banks. 
In addition to the Centre for Decision-Making and the RCC of the Head Office, an automated lending 
decision approach is in place for retail borrowers. The automated decisions follow a risk-based 
approach that includes risk-based pricing and the use of additional parameters when assessing the 
solvency of customers. Following the application review, loan offers are formed according to the 
requested terms, as well as by offering alternative solutions for all retail segments (including 
customers who do and do not participate in salary projects, pensioners, etc.). This approach takes into 
account the borrower’s risk profile and helps to minimise risks when taking decisions.
New SME business loan self-financing limits have been established for the SME Centre for Decision-
Making, Credit Committee of the branch network, digital credit products of corporate and SME 
clients, as well as retail limits for the DMC and RCC of the Head Office. In addition, the SME and retail 
lending processes have been optimised. 
To assess the Bank’s exposure to the risk of negative macroeconomic changes on foreign and 
domestic markets, as well as to determine the impact of the materialisation of stress scenarios 
(provision levels, credit rating migration and the share of non-performing loans), the Bank periodically 
conducts stress-testing of the loan portfolio. In 2023, the Bank conducted regular stress-testing 
using relatively conservative forecasts amid threats of a decline in global economies, rising inflation, 
lower oil prices and GDP levels, as well as geopolitical risks. The tests confirmed the resilience of the 
Bank’s capital to a decrease in asset quality. 
The existing Risk Rate rating model that the Bank uses to assess the likelihood of a default and the 
associated rating on corporate and SME clients is widely used to determine loan collateral criteria, as 
well as to conduct stress-testing on significant individual loans, and to optimise analysis and decision-
making for the Bank’s highly creditworthy clients. To keep the rating model up to date, as well as to 
improve the performance of the Bank’s model, it is regularly validated. The model underwent 
validation in 2023, and the outcome was successful.
Throughout 2023, work with problem loans continued, securing repayment through the sale of 
collateral, claims and lawsuits, transferring assets to doubtful asset management organisations and 
writing off bad debt. These measures have helped to reduce the share of overdue debt.
As of 31 December 2023, retail loans represented a significant share of Halyk Group’s loan portfolio 
(31.8%); consumer and mortgage loans accounted for 27.8% and 4%, respectively. Broken down by 
industry, the largest segments were services (9.6%), wholesale trade (8.5%), retail trade (6.5%), 
energy (4.9%) and the financial sector (3.8%).

In 2023, Halyk Group’s assets increased by 7.6% year-on-year. This was driven mainly by a rise in the 
loan portfolio on a net basis by KZT1,427 billion (up 18.2% year-on-year) and in the securities portfolio 
by KZT205.8 billion (up 10.7% year-on-year). The loan portfolio remains the largest item among Halyk 
Group’s assets: as of 31 December 2023, it accounted for 59.9% of the total. Other key assets 
included investments in securities (trading and investment portfolio; share of 13.7%), as well as cash 
and cash equivalents (share of 10.5%). 
The Group regularly checks the current positions of its existing limits for counterparty banks. 
Whenever it identifies any negative factors affecting their operations and/or their countries of 
operation, it makes immediate relevant adjustments to reduce the amount and term of such limits. 
For liquidity management purposes, the Bank maintains a stable and diversified structure of liabilities, 
which consists of borrowings and deposits with fixed maturities and liabilities payable on demand.
The breakdown of the Group’s liabilities in 2022 and 2023 was as follows:

The primary change in the liability structure in 2023 was in amounts due to customers. As of the year-
end, amounts due to customers rose by KZT417.5 billion (up 4.0%) in absolute terms. They continued 
to account for the largest proportion of liabilities, at 70.4% in 2023, compared with 73% in 2022. 
The proportions of term deposits and current accounts in amounts due to customers did not change 
materially, at 74.5% and 25.5%, respectively, compared with 69.0% and 31.0% as of 1 January 2023. 
In 2023, the amount of funds attracted from individuals increased by 11.2%, while that from legal 
entities decreased by 3.2%. Corporate clients tended to place their spare funds in government 
securities, as well as in foreign banks that have high rates on foreign currencies.

Amounts due to the Group’s customers, KZT billion
The Bank’s focus on raising funds in the domestic market helped to maintain leading positions in the 
customer account market. As of 1 January 2024, despite a slight decrease in the share of funds raised 
from customers, Halyk Bank was the market leader, with a share of retail deposits of 27.4% (compared 
with 30.4% at the end of 2022) and of corporate deposits of 36.5% (compared with 35.5% at the end 
of 2022).
4. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
In 2023, the Bank adhered to its conservative policy on currency position management, maintaining 
neutral positions in all currencies. 
The share of the Group’s assets in tenge increased from 64.3% in 2022 to 68.5% in 2023, while the 
share of the loan portfolio in tenge decreased from 83.0% to 82.6%.

interest rates and market risk by adjusting its interest rate position and maintaining a positive interest 
margin. 
Internal limits that restrict the level of market risk (currency, interest rate and price risks) are 
established by the authorised bodies within the risk appetite and are monitored daily. The limits are 
regularly reviewed for relevance and correlation with market conditions and the Bank’s risk appetite. 
In 2023, the rapid decline in annual inflation created space for the National Bank of Kazakhstan to 
reduce the base interest rate from 16.75% to 15.75%.
The Bank’s interest rate risk remained at an acceptable level within the established risk appetite limits.

5. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
In the normal course of its business, the Bank is exposed to operational risk. This is defined as the risk 
of losses resulting from inadequate and insufficient internal processes or systems, human factors or 
the influence of external events, excluding strategic and reputational risk. 
The operational risk management unit within the risk management function of the Bank has developed 
and uses various operational risk management tools, such as:
○ The Bank performs operational risk assessments when launching new products/services, systems 
and business processes (taking into account the processes used to control the testing and monitor 
the functioning of the product/service), or implementing changes thereto. The Organisation and 
Reinforcement of Preventive Action (ORAP) system is a fully functional and widely used tool. It has 
covered the most significant areas of the Bank’s operations since 2010. 
○ The Bank regularly collects and analyses information about operational risk events, which are 
registered and classified (per Basel classification) as appropriate in a special database. The 
information collected is used to generate regulatory and management reports on operational risks 
to support decisions about corrective actions to minimise overall operating losses. 
○ The Bank continues to develop an operational risk management tool, Key Risk Indicators (KRI). The 
Bank currently uses the KRI system in various business lines, which helps to identify the most 
significant risks to the Bank’s IT systems and critical business processes. 
○ The Bank also continues to develop other operational risk management tools, such as scenario 
analysis and risk self-assessments.
6. BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT
To ensure that it can respond to emergency situations rapidly and effectively, the Bank maintains 
systems and resources to manage and support business continuity. These include legal documents, 
infrastructure, competent employees and other items. 
The Bank has introduced a new hybrid work arrangement under which key employees work remotely 
on a rotational basis. 
The Bank has approved a detailed notification system for members of the Operational Response 
Headquarters, members of the Crisis Management Centre and the heads of departments of key 
employees in the event of an incident in the process of business continuity.
In 2023, to increase the awareness, distance learning was arranged for employees of the Head Office 
and regional branches, followed by testing on the business continuity management process at Halyk 
Bank.

7. IT AND INFORMATION SECURITY RISK 
MANAGEMENT
In 2023, the Bank continued its efforts to manage information technology (IT) and information 
security (IS) risks and further developed its IT and IS risk management system. During the year, the 
Bank conducted a cycle of IT and IS risk management activities. This included setting up a working 
group to update critical information assets; assessing, processing and monitoring risks; and reviewing 
the existing IT and IS risk management systems of the Bank’s subsidiaries. It then developed action 
plans to minimise the IT and IS risks identified. In addition, together with the departments involved, 
work is ongoing to analyse and minimise the risks of fraud incidents associated with IT and IS risks.
8. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
In 2023, the Bank continued to manage its capital to ensure the business continuity of all Group 
companies and optimise its debt-to-equity ratio. In the reporting period, the Bank ensured compliance 
with the capital requirements set by regulatory standards and the Basel Accords. 
Since 1 January 2016, the Group has calculated its capital adequacy ratios in accordance with the 
prudential standards prescribed for banks by Kazakhstan’s regulatory authorities, in consideration of 
the Basel Committee’s recommendations. In general, the National Bank of Kazakhstan’s methodology 
for calculating regulatory capital levels and its components comply with the Basel III standards. At the 
same time, the methodology applies separate regulatory adjustments that are not provided for by the 
Basel III standards but are allowed under the Basel III recommendations concerning the application of 
additional methodological amendments by local regulatory bodies. 
As part of its capital adequacy risk management efforts, the Bank also has an internal process in place 
for assessing capital adequacy. This approach to managing significant risks takes into account the 
volume of assets, the nature and complexity of operations, and the organisational structure, strategic 
plans, risk profile, regulatory and legal framework. Such risks are assessed and aggregated to 
determine a target capital adequacy level for the Bank to maintain a stable financial position and 
remain solvent.
In an effort to improve the risk management system, during the reporting year, the Bank developed 
and introduced an internal methodology and calculation of internal (economic) capital for major types 
of risks inherent in the Bank’s activities (credit, market and operational risks). 
9. COMPLIANCE RISKS

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code*
This section has been prepared in accordance with section DTR 7.2. of the UK Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules (corporate governance statements). 
The Bank is not formally required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the 
Financial Reporting Council, the independent regulator of the United Kingdom. However, in 
accordance with DTR 7.2, the Bank is obliged to disclose information about its compliance with both 
the Kazakh Corporate Governance Code and the existing corporate governance principles to which it 
adheres besides those stipulated in Kazakh legislation. 
The Bank considers the UK Corporate Governance Code a guideline for the further development of 
corporate governance. 
The Bank’s Corporate Governance Code contains several differences from the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Below are the main ones.
UK Corporate Governance Code The Bank’s Corporate Governance Code 
Stipulates a maximum three-year term for the 
re-election of directors.
Does not require the regular re-election of the 
Board. Instead, the scope of the General 
Shareholder Meeting includes determining the 
Board’s term of authority. 
The General Shareholder Meeting of 25 May 
2023 set a three-year term for the current 
Board. 
Provides for meetings of non-executive 
directors at least annually, particularly to 
appraise the chairman’s performance.
In 2023, non-executive directors held informal 
meetings that were also attended by the 
corporate secretary to discuss strategic issues, 
ways to improve corporate governance 
processes and the Board’s activities, and to 
improve the work of the corporate secretary.

Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code of Kazakhstan
The Bank sent a letter to the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (Ref. No. 11879 dated 23 June 2023) 
confirming that it had assessed its compliance with and observes 92.1% of the overall principles of the 
Model Code*. Compliance with the principles of the Model Code has risen since 2021, increasing from 
85.5% to 92.1%.
UK Corporate Governance Code The Bank’s Corporate Governance Code 
At least half of the Board, excluding the 
chairman, should consist of independent non-
executive directors.
In accordance with Kazakh legal requirements, at 
least one third of the Board’s members must be 
independent directors. The composition of the 
Board, as appointed by the General Shareholder 
Meetings on 25 May and 1 December 2023, 
includes six independent non-executive 
directors out of eight.
Non-executive directors should carefully 
analyse to what extent the Management 
Board’s work fulfils the aims and objectives set, 
monitor its activities, and ensure that financial 
information is complete and that financial 
controls and the risk management system are 
effective and reliable.
In accordance with Kazakh legal requirements, 
all members of the Board of Directors monitor 
the activities of the Management Board.
The Board of Directors should ensure that an 
appropriate succession plan is in place when 
appointing members of the Board of Directors 
and the senior management in order to create 
an appropriate balance of skills and experience 
in the company and the Board of Directors and 
to continuously refresh the talent pool.
Stipulates the procedure for creating the Board 
of Directors and requirements for its candidates, 
the aim being to ensure an optimal balance of 
experience and knowledge needed for the Board 
of Directors to function effectively. 
The Bank is working tirelessly to cultivate its corporate governance system, particularly by 
incorporating the principles and policies of sustainability (ESG) into its corporate governance system, 
transforming the committees of the Board of Directors, using an effective risk management and 
internal control system, and regularly improving the professional skills of internal audit, risk 
management and compliance employees, as well as the corporate secretary.
We firmly believe that achieving all of the key goals set in Halyk Group’s Development Strategy for 
2022-24 and adhering to the key principles of corporate governance and sustainability enshrined in 
the Corporate Governance Code will enable the Bank to achieve full compliance with the principles of 
the Model Code.  
Corporate governance events in 2023
○ On 25 May 2023, the Bank held its annual General Shareholder Meeting, at which 13 decisions were 
taken regarding matters under consideration, including information about shareholders’ appeals 
concerning the actions of the Bank and its officials.
○ A new version of the Bank’s Charter was approved at the annual General Shareholder Meeting, with 
the removal of the word “savings” from the Bank’s full official name. The Bank was re-registered by 
the government due to the change in its name, and now its full name is Joint-Stock Company Halyk 
Bank of Kazakhstan. New versions of the Bank’s Corporate Governance Code and the Regulation on 
the Board of Directors were approved at the annual General Shareholder Meeting.
○ At the annual General Shareholder Meeting, the decision was taken to pay dividends for 2022 of 
KZT25.38 per common share, which represented 50% of the Bank’s total consolidated net income 
for 2022. The Bank paid dividends of KZT276.852 billion on common shares to the current bank 
accounts of the Bank’s shareholders on record with the Bank or listed in the system of the securities

Board assessment results for 2023
1.  Board work style and culture 
○ The Board follows a classic management model in its activities due to the need to comply with 
applicable laws, risks and shareholder interests. The Board’s psychological atmosphere and work 
style promote constructiveness and efficiency. The Board of Directors, Management Board and 
other key employees of the Bank need to continue to have regular in-person meetings to exchange 
information and develop new ideas for the Bank’s sustainable development and the creation of 
Halyk Group’s Development Strategy for 2025-27. 
○ The key motivating factors for Board members are: the scale of the Bank’s operations as the largest 
financial institution in the country; the vibrant personalities of the Bank’s senior management; the 
opportunity to share experience and knowledge with other Board members; the desire to achieve 
self-fulfilment at the strategic level; and a high level of transparency and corporate governance. 
○ The Board supports initiatives to develop corporate governance, ESG and the ecosystem, and to 
introduce new tools that can improve its performance. 
○ The Board possesses the necessary expertise in finance, financial reporting, internal control and 
audit, banking, risk management, IT and corporate governance. 
○ The most critical areas of the Board’s expertise are: digital transformation; innovation; risk 
management; finance; internal control and audit; human resources and talent development; 
strategic management; and sustainable development (ESG). 
○ The key skills for the Board to function effectively are: the ability to make decisions under uncertain 
conditions; constructive criticism and feedback; creative thinking and the search for ideas; and 
international experience in business and IT.
○ There are no obvious or latent conflicts among the Board members that affect its efficiency, and all 
Board members focus on working together efficiently as a collegial management body.
○ The relationship between the Board of Directors and Management Board contributes to the Bank’s 
ability to operate in the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders (customers, employees 
and so on). 
2.  Board composition and structure
○ The Board’s composition is optimal and balanced (in terms of members’ knowledge and 
experience) to perform the functions assigned to it, including to oversee the implementation of the 
Bank’s Development Strategy. The Board of Directors intends to enhance its expertise in 
information technology, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, audits, ESG, big data and innovation in 
the banking business. 
○ In 2023, significant changes were made to the Board’s composition (the number of Board members 
was increased from seven to eight people) with the election of three new Board members 
(Zhaksybek Kulekeyev, Zhomart Nurabayev and Hermann Tischendorf), who have extensive 
experience and knowledge in such areas as IT, telecommunications, digital products, ecosystems, 
finance, economics and management. One of the Board members advises the European Union on 
sanctions compliance.
○ The Bank has an optimal system in place to improve Board members’ expertise and qualifications. 
The Bank monitors technological advances and new approaches in banking, in both Kazakhstan and 
other countries where it operates. Where necessary, additional training will be provided for Board 
members. In 2023, information sessions (seminars and training) were held for the Board of 
Directors and the Management Board in banking, finance, macroeconomics and strategic 
management.

○ The Bank has an effective system for selecting Board members that helps it to attract true 
professionals. It has formed a roster of candidates who have the right to apply to be independent 
directors of the Bank and its subsidiaries. One potential source of information about candidates for 
the Board of Directors may be details from the Bank’s minority shareholders (lists of potential Board 
candidates that may be requested by the IR Service within a period sufficient to verify their 
compliance with the requirements of Kazakh laws).
○ At present, the gender structure of the Board of Directors consists of 87% men and 13% women (the 
slight change in the Board’s gender structure compared with 2022 is due to an increase in the total 
number of Board members from seven to eight people). To comply with best international practices, 
the assessment recommended considering the possibility of increasing the percentage of women 
on the Board of Directors from 13% to 30% (for example, women account for 30% of management 
bodies in the US and 39% in Europe). 
○ The average age of members of the Board of Directors is 59 years (for comparison, the average age 
of Board members in the 2022 report was 62 years). A review of corporate governance practices in 
Kazakhstan prepared by the international consulting company Korn Ferry* shows that the average 
age of a member of the Board of Directors in Kazakhstan is 53 years, while in Europe it is 60 years.
3.  Board planning and operating procedures
○ All newly elected Board members receive a Board Book containing the information needed to 
quickly familiarise themselves with the work of the Bank and Board of Directors. This includes key 
milestones in the Bank’s history, Halyk Group’s Development Strategy, the Bank’s organisational 
structure, the procedures of the Board of Directors and Management Board, and the duties of Board 
members. All newly elected and current Board members also have access to training materials on 
ESG topics. 
○ The mandate of the Board of Directors is established in the new version of the Bank’s charter, 
corresponds to its current strategic objectives and does not require any adjustments.
○ The quantity, frequency and duration of Board meetings, including the ratio of in-person and 
absentee meetings, meets the Bank’s needs (the Board held seven in-person meetings and 61 
absentee meetings in 2023). Board members intend to continue working in a hybrid format (two to 
three in-person meetings and two to three absentee meetings held by videoconference).
○ In December 2023, a strategic session was organised and attended by all members of the Board of 
Directors and the Management Board. The assessment recommended that the Board of Directors 
and the Management Board increase the number of formal and informal working meetings (for 
example, at meetings of the committees of the Board of Directors) to hold in-depth sessions on the 
implementation of the Bank’s business objectives and strategy. 
○ To comply with the best international corporate governance practices, the assessment 
recommended analysing the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (as amended in 
September 2023)** and the UK Corporate Governance Code*** (as amended in January 2024) 
and, where necessary, incorporating their provisions into the Bank’s Corporate Governance Code.
4.  Effectiveness of corporate procedures and workflow 
○ The existing corporate procedures allow the Board of Directors to respond to external and internal 
threats promptly (pandemic, terrorist attacks, military conflicts, sanctions and so on) and, if 
necessary, take measures to ensure the continuity of the Bank’s operations. 
○ The process of preparing for and holding Board meetings is detailed in the Bank’s internal 
regulations, which describe the operating procedures and logistics under normal conditions 
(without restrictions). 
○ The new version of the Rules for Preparing Documents Related to Convening and Holding Meetings 
of the Bank’s Board of Directors has helped to improve quality and reduce the amount of paper 
materials for members of the Board of Directors (the volume of materials printed for the Board of 
Directors decreased by 70% compared with 2020-21). 
○ To incorporate the experience gained from working during the pandemic, corporate procedures 
have been adapted to the conditions in which the Bank operates (remote work, use of software for 
video meetings and workshops, restrictions on movement within cities and countries, lack of 
opportunities to print and physically sign documents and so on).
○ In 2023, the Bank switched to a new electronic document management system (Thesis EDMS), 
which helped to digitise numerous internal document approval procedures. A project was launched 
in 2023 to develop and incorporate the Meetings module (Thesis EDMS) to prepare for and hold 
meetings of collegial bodies (the Board of Directors, Management Board and their committees) in 
digital format (this project is scheduled to be completed in 2024).
○ The Bank follows best practices and takes into account the specifics of its operations to determine 
which internal documents and policies must be developed and/or approved by the Board of 
Directors. The Board regularly analyses the Bank’s internal regulations that fall within its remit and 
considers proposals of the Management Board to bring them into compliance with current Kazakh 
law, reduce bureaucracy and simplify corporate governance processes.

5.  Functional areas of the Board’s work
○ In 2023, new versions of the Charter, Corporate Governance Code and the Regulation on the Board 
of Directors were drafted and approved to incorporate sustainable development principles (ESG) 
into the Bank’s corporate governance system, as well as to expand the powers and responsibilities 
of the Board of Directors and the Management Board to incorporate such principles into the Bank’s 
operations
○ Materials presented for meetings of the Board of Directors are complete, high-quality and contain 
necessary and sufficient information on the agenda items for a member of the Board of Directors to 
make an informed decision. The procedures for preparing materials for meetings of the Board of 
Directors of the Bank are standardised and enshrined in the relevant IRR of the Bank, which is 
reviewed on a regular basis and adapted to changes in the processes of preparing and holding 
meetings of the Bank’s Board of Directors.
○ To strengthen control over the implementation of the Bank’s Development Strategy, plans and 
programmes, the Board uses its Strategic Planning Committee, as well as informal meetings of 
members of the Board of Directors and the Management Board, to discuss business, the Bank’s 
Strategy, short- and long-term market trends, and competitor analysis in Kazakhstan and the 
countries where Halyk Group operates. 
○ The Board sets and approves KPIs for the Bank’s executives and regularly reviews the Management 
Board’s performance regarding budget indicators and strategic objectives for the reporting period 
at least once every six months.  
Relations with minority shareholders 
The Bank strives to continuously improve its system for working with minority shareholders, which 
allows them to ask questions and receive the necessary information conveniently (in writing, by email 
and/or by telephone). 
Communications from minority shareholders and their wishes are analysed regularly. The Bank 
informs shareholders of all substantial news, corporate events, changes to its activities that relate to 
holders of its shares and bonds, and planned events via its online resource, the websites of stock 
exchanges and financial reporting depositary websites. 
Where necessary, employees of the Head Office provide consultations to branch employees 
regarding shareholder relations, accrued dividends, changes in shareholders’ banking details, the 
transfer of inheritance rights and other matters.
Dividend policy 
Shareholders’ rights to dividends and the procedure for the payment thereof are stipulated by the 
Bank’s Charter and Corporate Governance Code approved by General Shareholder Meetings. 
The Board of Directors approved the Bank’s Dividend Policy in September 2012. Its main purpose is 
to establish a clear and transparent decision-making mechanism regarding dividend payments, 
including their size and the procedure and timelines for their payment. 
Payment of dividends on common shares is subject to the Bank, registry system or the nominal 
holding accounting system having the correct shareholder information no later than 90 calendar days 
from the day after which the General Shareholder Meeting takes a decision regarding the payment of 
a dividend on the Bank’s common shares. 
If the Bank, registry system or the nominal holding accounting system do not have the shareholder’s 
current information, dividends on the Bank’s common shares are paid to an account for unclaimed 
funds opened in the Central Securities Depository accounting system within five business days after 
the expiration of 90 calendar days from the day after which the General Shareholder Meeting takes a 
decision regarding the payment of a dividend on the Bank’s common shares.
Total dividend payments for previous financial years are as follows*.

Awareness and training of members of the Board of Directors and Management Board
In 2023, the Board Book containing basic information about the history and current positions of the 
Bank and Halyk Group, an organisational chart of the Bank and a director’s responsibilities was 
updated for new members of the Board of Directors. 
Members of the Board of Directors are also given information about the main changes in banking laws. 
In 2023, seminars and training sessions were held for members of the Bank’s Board of Directors and 
Management Board covering strategic development, change management and IT. 
The Bank intends to further develop and improve the knowledge and qualifications of members of the 
Board of Directors.
Risk management and internal control
Roles and responsibilities
Risk management and internal control functions are distributed within the Bank as follows.
○ The Board of Directors carries out strategic governance on internal control and risk management, 
and approves and periodically revises its policies. The working body of the Board of Directors for 
risk management and internal control is the Audit Committee. 
○ The Board of Directors also considers major transactions of the Bank, transactions where the Bank 
has an interest, and related-party transactions, including where there is an absence of preferential 
conditions. 
○ The Management Board is responsible for the implementation of risk management policies. The 
Bank has the following key committees that carry out various risk management and control 
functions: Credit Committee of the Head Office, Credit Committee of the Branch Network, Retail 
Credit Committee, Bad Loans Committee, Committee for Managing Assets and Liabilities, and Risk 
Committee. 
○ The Bank’s structural units are directly responsible for identifying and assessing inherent risks, the 
adequacy of controls and business continuity. 
○ Independent risk management and compliance services are responsible for organising the risk 
management system, which ensures the identification, assessment, control and monitoring of 
credit, operational, market, compliance and liquidity risks. The risk management function is headed 
by the chief risk officer and the compliance function is headed by the chief compliance controller. 
○ The internal audit service performs independent and objective evaluations of the risk management, 
internal control and corporate governance systems.
The Bank acknowledges that it is impossible to fully eliminate the risks inherent in its banking 
activities. However, the Bank is confident that its risk management system is capable of significantly 
minimising them. 
Compliance risk management system
The Bank has developed an effective compliance risk management system, which ensures:
○ The effective functioning of the Bank and compliance of its activities with its strategy, risk profile 
and risk appetite 
○ The existence of a compliance risk management system that corresponds to the current market 
situation, as well as the strategy, size and complexity of the Bank’s operations 
○ Compliance of the activities of the Bank and each of its employees with Kazakh laws, including the 
regulatory legal acts of an authorised body, internal documents regulating the procedure for the 
provision of services, the applicable legislation of foreign states, as well as international standards 
concerning compliance, including documents of the Basel Committee on banking supervision, 
FATF and the Wolfsberg AML/CFT principles 
○ A minimal risk of negative consequences associated with losses/damages due to a failure by the 
Bank and its employees to comply with the requirements of Kazakh laws, including the regulatory 
legal acts of an authorised body, the Bank’s internal documents regulating the procedure for the 
provision of services by the Bank and operations on the financial market, as well as the legislation of 
foreign countries that affect the Bank’s activities 
○ A minimal risk of negative consequences associated with the imposition of sanctions against the 
Bank by suspending or revoking its licence to conduct all or certain banking transactions, sanctions 
in the form of the imposition or levying of a fine, or the imposition of limited enforcement measures 
by an authorised body 
○ The establishment of a unified compliance risk management system at the Bank 
○ The conduct of business in compliance with Halyk Group’s business ethics and standards
‘Three lines of defence’ risk management system
Risk management at the Bank is based on the ‘three lines of defence’ system. This integrated 
approach to building a compliance risk management system delineates roles and authority among 
structural units to take measures aimed at minimising risks that are inherent in the Bank’s operations. 
The first line of defence comprises the Bank’s employees, including subordinate functions; the second 
line of defence is the Compliance Service; and the third line of defence is the internal audit function.
14
Corporate 
Governance

--- Page 82 ---
82
○ The first line of defence is the controls developed to ensure correct day-to-day operations by the 
Bank’s various structural units. The controls are developed by the structural units and are an integral 
part of business and other processes. Clearly delineated controls help to ensure sufficient risk 
mitigation and compliance with the laws of Kazakhstan, internal regulations, internal documents, as 
well as the laws of other countries that influence the Bank’s operations. The units themselves 
manage and monitor the controls, enabling them to independently detect risks, weaknesses in 
business processes and possible unforeseen events, and to take corrective action 
○ The second line of defence is compliance control by the Compliance Service.
○ The Compliance Service arranges for procedures to comply with the requirements of the civil, tax 
and banking laws of Kazakhstan; the laws of Kazakhstan on the state regulation, control and 
supervision of the financial market and financial organisations; the laws of Kazakhstan governing 
currency regulation, currency control, payments and payment systems, the provision of pensions, 
the securities market, accounting and financial reporting, credit bureaus and the formation of credit 
histories, collection activities, mandatory deposit guarantees, AML/CFT efforts and joint-stock 
companies; the laws of foreign states that influence the Bank’s activities; as well as the Bank’s 
internal documents regulating the procedure for the provision of services by the Bank and 
transactions on the financial market. It provides comprehensive and reliable information to the 
Board of Directors, Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the Management Board about the 
existence of a compliance risk.
 The Bank’s internal documents delegate separate functions of compliance risk management, if 
necessary, to the Bank’s other structural units, provided there is no conflict of interest.
○ The third line of defence consists of an independent assessment of the quality and effectiveness of 
compliance risk management by the internal audit function (see the Internal Audit section).
 While acknowledging that it is impossible to exclude risks inherent in banking operations 
completely, the Bank is confident that its risk management system enables them to be minimised 
significantly.
System for monitoring the Bank’s compliance with international and country-specific 
economic sanctions
The Bank complies with international and national economic sanctions and adheres to the principles 
of transparency, fairness and integration into the global community in its activities. 
The Bank is required to comply with international and country-specific economic sanctions due to: 
1.  Kazakhstan’s membership in the United Nations, which obliges the Bank to comply with the 
sanctions and embargoes established by the resolutions of the UN Security Council 
2.  The listing of the Bank’s securities on the London Stock Exchange 
3.  The existence of contractual relations with foreign counterparties, including nostro correspondent 
relations with banks in the US, EU, UK and other countries 
4.  The extraterritorial nature of the imposition of international and country-specific economic 
sanctions
To minimise possible compliance risks, the Compliance Service, along with other concerned units at 
the Bank, analyses customers and their transactions for compliance with applicable sanctions 
requirements. When analysing the transactions of the Bank’s clients and counterparties to determine 
whether there is a sanctions element or a scheme for evading/circumventing international economic 
sanctions, the Bank takes the following measures:
1.  Checks all the parties to the transaction (beneficial owners, founders/shareholders and authorised 
persons) based on the sanctions lists of applicable jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, the 
US OFAC, EU, UK, UN, local lists and so on, if necessary
2.  Verifies whether there is any negative information about all the parties to the transaction in reliable 
information sources, including specialised databases used by the Bank (World-Check and others)
3.  Checks the parties to the transaction for country-specific (geographical) risks
4.  Conducts inspections of goods/services for compliance with applicable sanctions requirements, 
including the manufacturers of goods, end users of the goods/services and other parties, if any.
To avoid the risk of the Bank failing to comply with international or country-specific economic 
sanctions when serving clients, the Bank has the right to refuse or terminate a client’s transaction, 
payment or transfer, including a bank that has a Loro correspondent account with the Bank, at any 
stage and in any currency if such refusal or termination is due to: 
1.  The effect of international or country-specific economic sanctions 
2.  The effect of international and country-specific economic sanctions that restrict the export/import 
of goods, technologies, equipment, natural resources or other items
3.  Actions that aim to evade international economic sanctions
Considering the complex geopolitical situation around the world and the ever-changing sanctions 
environment, the Bank regularly monitors information/announcements about international economic 
sanctions using official public sources based on which (if necessary) it revises/updates its procedures 
to minimise the risk of violating/bypassing sanctions.

Internal audit
The Bank’s internal audit department acts as the third line of defence.
To ensure that the internal audit is independent and objective, the internal audit department is 
functionally subordinate and accountable to the Bank’s Board of Directors. Working interaction with 
members of the Board of Directors is carried out via the Audit Committee and directly. The head of 
internal audit oversees the day-to-day operations of the internal audit department.
In accordance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, the 
internal audit function’s mission is to maintain and increase the value of Halyk Group through 
independent audits and consultations using a risk-based approach and providing recommendations 
to improve the Group’s operations.
The internal audit function is guided in its work by legislative norms, regulatory requirements, the 
Standards and the Bank’s internal regulatory documents.
The Regulation on the Internal Audit Department, which was approved by the Board of Directors, 
states that internal audit employees may conduct audits of any structural unit or subsidiary of the 
Bank on a risk-oriented basis and have unlimited access to relevant documents, information, premises 
and assets during the performance of such engagements.
The Board of Directors approves the annual work plan and budget of the internal audit department. 
The internal audit department’s reports are provided to the boards of branches, the Management 
Board, the Audit Committee and the Bank’s Board of Directors. Current issues related to the activities 
of the internal audit department are promptly discussed with the chairperson of the Management 
Board and the chairman of the Board of Directors. The internal audit department on a quarterly basis 
provides the Board of Directors with a progress report on how the Bank’s structural units and 
subsidiaries are implementing measures based on the results of the department’s audit 
engagements.
By conducting audits and consultations, where applicable, the internal audit department reviews the 
Bank’s compliance with ESG requirements and makes the appropriate recommendations for 
improvement, if necessary. Internal audit employees undergo regular training on ESG and apply the 
knowledge they gain when performing audit engagements.
The activities of the Bank’s internal audit department comply with the International Standards for the 
Professional Practice of Internal Auditing and the Code of Ethics for Internal Auditors of the Institute 
of Internal Auditors. An independent external auditor confirmed such compliance twice in 2017 and 
2022. The internal audit department provides ongoing methodological assistance to bring the 
internal audit services of the Bank’s subsidiaries into compliance with the abovementioned Standards 
and Code of Ethics. Several internal audit employees have international professional certifications to 
conduct internal, IT and information security audits.
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct 
Compliance with the principles of business ethics and responsible behaviour are the key components 
of corporate culture at any company. Each employee of the Bank takes decisions on a daily basis that 
may have financial and reputational consequences for the Bank and could also affect people and 
society. 
As part of the short-term plan for the implementation of the sustainable development principles and 
goals, the Bank drafted and approved the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the Code of Ethics), 
which replaced the Bank’s previous Rules of Corporate Ethics. The Code of Ethics was drafted in 
accordance with the generally recognised principles and norms of international law, the laws of 
Kazakhstan, corporate governance standards, the Charter, the Corporate Governance Code and other 
internal documents of the Bank, as well as best practices. The objectives of the Code of Ethics are:
1.  Enshrine the mission, values, principles and standards of business ethics and behaviour that guide 
the Bank’s officials and employees in their activities 
2.  Develop a uniform corporate culture based on high ethical standards, and support an atmosphere 
of trust, mutual respect and decency 
3.  Increase and maintain trust in the Bank from shareholders, clients, business partners, the public 
authorities, the public and other stakeholders, and strengthen its reputation as an open and honest 
player on the financial market 
4.  Assist in interacting effectively with stakeholders 
5.  Prevent violations of the current laws of Kazakhstan by the Bank’s employees 
The Code of Ethics provides an updated understanding of the Bank’s values and principles, as well as 
general rules of ethics that everyone who represents the Bank must understand and follow. The Code 
of Ethics contains mandatory standards of ethics and business conduct, and serves as a guide for 
each official and employee to take the correct decision, regardless of position, whether working at the 
Bank full-time or part-time, as well as for third parties hired for paid contractual services. 
14
Corporate 
Governance

--- Page 84 ---
84
All the Bank’s documents, including those that formalise relations with clients, business partners, 
government agencies, competitors and employees, are drafted and approved taking into account the 
provisions of the Code of Ethics. Together, these documents provide a clearly articulated overall 
framework for ensuring compliance with business ethics requirements and are essential components 
of the Bank’s business ethics framework. 
The Code of Ethics is a guide for taking the right decisions and a standard for conducting open and 
honest business, as well as engaging in responsible, professional and ethical behaviour. 
Bank executives seek to set a personal example of commitment to the Bank. They allocate time to 
create a talent pool for the Bank, consult and coach, and bring employees together in a team united by 
a common mission, values and principles. 
Each employee is obliged to maintain the Bank’s image and business reputation at a high level. 
In cases where the ethical standards stipulated by the Code of Ethics are higher than the standards 
defined by business practice and applicable law, the Bank adheres to the standards of the Code of 
Ethics.
Nomination and contracting of directors (general information on procedures) 
When nominated, directors are subject to approval by the regulator in accordance with its rules 
governing the issuance of consent to the appointment (election) of executives of financial 
organisations, branches of non-resident banks in Kazakhstan, branches of non-resident insurance 
(reinsurance) organisations in Kazakhstan, branches of non-resident insurance brokers in 
Kazakhstan, banking and insurance holdings, and the Insurance Payment Guarantee Fund. These 
include requirements for executives of branches of non-resident banks in Kazakhstan, branches of 
non-resident insurance (reinsurance) organisations in Kazakhstan and branches of non-resident 
insurance brokers in Kazakhstan, criteria concerning the lack of an impeccable business reputation, 
and the list of documents required to receive approval. 
Contracts are concluded with directors in accordance with the Bank’s Policy on Management 
Personnel Remunerations and Reimbursements and Creating an Annual Performance Results Bonus 
Awards Reserve.

Over the 14 years, Halyk Bank funded basketball lessons for children from orphanages and boarding 
schools and provided them with the best regional coaches, training and kits, as well as sports 
equipment as part of the People’s League project.
In 2020, the project had to be suspended temporarily because of the pandemic.
In 2023, Halyk Bank decided to resume the People’s League.
The project involved foster children from 16 orphanages in 16 regions of the country.
Since 2005, Halyk Bank has spent almost KZT500 million on the project, including KZT53 million in 
2023. More than 3,000 children from orphanages and boarding schools have competed in the 
People’s League.

Each year, the People’s League project culminates with the Cup of Hope championship. The league’s 
teams competed at the final tournament in Almaty for the title of the best team in basketball. In 2023,

possibility of subsequent internship at the Bank.
Halyk previously donated such laboratories to Kazakh-British Technical University, International IT 
University and SDU University.

ULTTYQ ÓNIM 2022 Exhibition of Kazakh Manufacturers

Projects implemented through the Halyk Charity Fund 
Since it was established in 2016, the Halyk Charity Fund has focused primarily on developing and 
supporting social initiatives, encouraging projects in sport, education and culture, and providing 
assistance to the public during emergencies. 
The tragic events in Kazakhstan of January 2022 and the unstable geopolitical situation in 
neighbouring states continued to place a tremendous burden on the country’s social protection 
system. 
In 2023, the fund continued to focus on providing social assistance to the country and the population 
by supporting the proposals and initiatives of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. 
In 2023, the Fund used more than KZT2 billion from the Bank to implement the following 
projects:

HALYK BANK’S HR SYSTEM 
The Bank’s human resources (HR) system is governed by the Kazakh Labour Code, Tax Code, Law on 
Banks and Banking Activities and other regulatory acts. 
The main objectives of the Bank’s HR policy are to: 
1.  Observe the principles of legality, justice and equal opportunities in the Bank’s activities 
2.  Improve the organisational structure and HR planning 
3.  Adapt new employees and engage existing personnel 
4.  Train and develop employees and create a talent pool 
5.  Oversee productivity, employee incentivisation and salaries 
6.  Provide social support for employees 
7.  Foster a positive corporate culture 
The Bank’s HR policy complies with Halyk Group’s Development Strategy, the organisational structure 
and risk profile of the Bank, the results achieved and Kazakh legislation. 
Halyk Bank’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (“the Code of Ethics”) regulates interpersonal 
relations among employees and officials at the Bank, reflecting its values, mission and culture, but also 
enshrines the Bank’s moral position in joint activities with all concerned parties, such as shareholders, 
business partners, customers, government agencies, competitors and, ultimately, society as a whole 
(https://halykbank.kz/en/about-bank/korporativnoe-upravlenie).
The Code of Ethics enshrines the following principles: 
1.  Honesty 
2.  Fairness 
3.  Openness 
4.  Protection 
5.  Preventing conflicts of interest

To successfully implement the Bank’s stated goals, the Bank’s structure and headcount are regularly 
reviewed. In 2023, certain divisions were also optimised and new ones were created.
The Bank continues to expand the range of self-service processes available to staff in terms of 
employment-related activities, as well as to increase the scope of management reporting regarding 
personnel.
Candidate selection
Human capital is the primary competitive advantage for any financial organisation, so it is crucial for 
us to maintain a high level of stability and staffing. The Bank uses different recruiting and selection 
algorithms to attract talent based on the uniqueness and strategic value of its various positions. 
However, regardless of the personnel group, the system used to recruit and select staff is based on an 
objective assessment of their professional skills and expertise. In 2023, the Bank’s Head Office alone 
processed more than 1,510 recruitment applications and hired 833 new employees.
Considering that the global increase in competition among employers for professionals who 
specialise in high technologies is a major challenge, it is paramount for us to create a corporate culture 
of innovation and look for ways to improve HR management processes. In 2023, we set and achieved 
our goal of attracting no more than 40% of professionals (middle and senior positions) from the 
market, and filling 60% of vacancies with internal resources using the internal talent pool and a 
promising pool of students thanks to our HalykStart internship programme for IT specialties. We are 
also increasing cooperation with leading universities to expand the recruitment funnel and immerse 
potential young talent in the Halyk culture through the Halyk Academy. As of the start of 2023, the 
Bank had laboratories at Kazakh-British Technical University, International IT University and SDU 
University, and in the fourth quarter of 2023, it opened a laboratory at Satbayev University. In addition, 
we regularly take part in job fairs, including Digital Bridge.
In an effort to cultivate leadership and position itself as an organisation that is ready for innovation, the 
Bank held two successful Halyk OIY hackathons (internal and external), which encourage workers to 
be proactive in developing new ideas and technologies.
To improve the efficiency of recruitment, we fully revised the entire hiring process – from searching for 
candidates to their first working day – and introduced robotic process automation technologies. As a 
result, we were able to post vacancies and search for CVs based on the criteria given by the 
department in need on HH.kz without involving any recruiters, and have potential candidates consider 
job offers on WhatsApp. Details of this project were shared at the Digital Almaty 2024 Forum.
We pay special attention to onboarding for new employees and supplemented the adaptation process 
in 2023 with a motivational interview on a Telegram bot, which provides feedback in a short time.
Automating and optimising processes helps to free resources for other major projects. For example, 
a team of recruiters held hackathons in 2023 and also launched a socially significant career guidance 
project for children called Halyk Bolashagy. Children of Bank employees aged 10 to 16 years are the 
target audience of the pilot project. Specialists from the Bank’s different businesses hold meetings 
(once a month with two groups of 45 children) to talk about specific aspects of their professions. This 
can help to choose a professional path and open a world of opportunities in the banking sector for 
them.
Staff development 
Halyk Bank considers it essential to ensure a continuous learning process so that employees maintain 
their current knowledge. The main focuses of training are new products, updates to existing ones, 
customer service standards taking into account some of the special aspects of the sales/service 
channel and digital skills. The Bank also pays special attention to building standardised career paths 
and training programmes for front-line units.
Third parties were also engaged to train front-office employees, as teachers from the branch network 
continued to provide theoretical training at the following online schools: 
○ Consultant training school 
○ Professional cashier school 
○ Manager school
Combined with on-the-job training in sales channels under the guidance of an experienced mentor, 
this ensures a continuous inflow of candidates. More than 1,300 external individuals graduated from 
these schools in 2023. Of these, 1,130 people (84%) were hired by the Bank.

After being hired, new employees undergo training based on their development trajectories, which 
include distance-learning offerings and webinar meetings:
○ For employees of the SME unit 
○ For employees of the retail banking unit 
○ For employees of the transactions department
Halyk Bank continued to use an adaptation programme for new staff members, which not only enables 
new employees to quickly and effectively adapt to new work processes, but also helps them to 
integrate into the corporate culture easily.
In 2023, corporate training for employees of the Head Office emphasised the introduction of flexible 
project management methodology. Trainings sessions were conducted for product owners, Agile 
coaches and Chapter leads based on the Agile and Scrum methodologies. More than 120 Bank 
employees completed such training.
Customer service remains a priority area of development for front-office employees. Extensive 
training on service and correcting common errors was conducted for around 1,800 cashiers. In 
addition, cashiers underwent training on skills for managing difficult situations.
The theme of customer service encompassed all managers and key employees of the Bank’s sales 
channels, with more than 750 people completing an in-person training course titled “DNA of Service. 
Emotions in Customer Relations”.
The Bank developed and held a comprehensive training programme for employees of the SME unit of 
the branch network. This included a mobile marathon that aimed to improve the performance results 
of small business employees, and a face-to-face training session titled ‘Reboot. Emphasis on 
Efficiency’, which over 350 employees of small and medium-sized businesses attended. 
On two occasions, business coaches visited all 25 branches of the Bank to provide training. This not 
only improved the skills and knowledge of the trainees, but also served as a useful motivational and 
team-building tool for employees of the branch network.
Employee mental health has become one of the most important topics of discussion in all businesses, 
including banking. To this end, we held mental health training and morning meditation sessions for 
employees of the Head Office. More than 500 Bank employees completed mental health training.
Two training programmes were developed and conducted for employees of the contact centre 
department, which aimed to improve the level of customer service and telephone sales skills. More 
than 400 employees from the department completed this training.
Employees of subsidiaries also underwent corporate training. The Bank’s business coaches 
conducted training for employees and managers of Halyk Bank Kyrgyzstan, Halyk Leasing and Halyk 
Insurance Company.
Developing managers’ skills and tapping into their leadership potential remains a priority in the 
current strategic period. Along with the Nazarbayev University Graduate School of Business, we 
continued training managers as part of a programme that covered strategy and digital transformation, 
digital marketing, FinTech and banking, change management, leadership competencies and 
emotional intelligence.
In 2023, 44 managers of the Halyk Group underwent training as part of this programme, including 11 
managers from subsidiaries, and another 45 managers began training, which will be completed in 
2024.
The HR department and the retail business unit continued the Academy of Leaders project, whose 
programme was thoroughly transformed and included two levels of training in 2023: basic and 
advanced. The basic level of training contained modules on leadership, customer service, effective 
communication, personal transformation and change management. The advanced level of the 
programme included such topics as mindful leadership, meetings, emotional intelligence, combating 
procrastination and mental health.
Around 200 people graduated from the Academy of Leaders and formed a talent pool for the retail 
unit of the branch network. All the Academy of Leaders graduates received additional training from 
external coach Andrey Burlutsky on how to remain resilient in turbulent times.
The Bank continues to develop the members of its talent pool. In 2023, the training programme for 
members of the talent pool was held in a game-based format, as more than 100 succession 
candidates completed the following two business games:
○ The Leader – a training aid to develop leadership skills
○ The Boss – a training aid to develop managerial skills

In 2023, external service providers were brought in to hold 20 training events in a corporate format 
(in-person/webinar), which over 1,000 employees from the Head Office and branches attended. 
Intensive ESG training was also conducted for employees of the Bank’s Head Office who are involved 
in writing the sustainability report and for directors of the branch network. 
Individual training was provided for 264 employees of the Bank, which devoted considerable attention 
to developing specialists with digital skills who have been trained in DevOps, iOS development, SQL 
and Software Architect. As in 2022, employees tended to prefer remote access to educational 
technologies and resources on the platforms Coursera, Slurm, Skillbox, SkillFactory, Data Boom, 
Datanomix.pro and Yandex Practicum. 
The Bank provides opportunities to exchange knowledge and skills in professional communities 
through conferences, reference visits and hackathons. In 2023, more than 40 people took part in 
professional conferences and forums, while 17 executives paid reference visits to market leaders in 
the UAE and Singapore.
Mandatory training (health and safety, industrial and electrical safety as well as Basics of Fire Safety) 
was completed by 124 of the Bank’s employees. Employees of the compliance control department 
took mandatory AML/CFT courses at a specialised training centre.
Two Annual meeting of branch directors were held in Uzbekistan and Georgia, similar events were 
organised for the heads of the SME and RB units, and 10 business-specific seminars and meetings 
were held for managers and employees of the branch network.
With co-financing provided by the Bank, 36 employees of the internal audit department and collateral 
relations department received professional certifications and passed exams.
As part of a comprehensive development programme for branch directors, as well as to share 
experience and study the work specifics of directors and business units from other regions, cluster 
training was held for all directors of the branch network. A total of 31 branch employees completed 
internal banking training.
Since 2022, we have been assessing the managerial skills of Halyk Group executives through the OPQ 
questionnaire from SHL. All the Bank’s executives underwent an initial assessment, and in 2023, 42 
executives from subsidiaries (chief executives and their deputies) completed the questionnaire. This 
assessment gave executives the opportunity to demonstrate their strengths, which they can use to 
achieve better business results, as well as their expertise on how to further develop the Bank’s 
business.
We continue to increase the number of workers who undergo distance learning and testing. In 2023, 
498,008 units were scheduled, up 54% from 2022.
We use the distance learning system (DLS) to conduct mass training that encompasses more than 
10,000 people on such topics as the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Anti-Corruption Policy, 
Personal Safety of Sales Channel Employees, Fundamentals of Information Security, Internal Control 
and Combating Financial Fraud, Environmental Policy etc.
The number of people who use the DLS mobile application is increasing, which provides all the Bank’s 
employees with the opportunity to take courses and read books on self-development, personal 
effectiveness, psychology and business 24/7. The Bank’s electronic library has been replenished with 
publications in the Kazakh language. As of the end of 2023, the mobile application had more than 
4,000 active users.
Today, the DLS not only offers distance learning and testing for the Bank’s employees, but also for its 
subsidiaries: Tenge Bank, Halyk-Leasing, Halyk Finance, Halyk Aktiv and KUSA Halyk.
The Bank implemented an employee self-development programme by announcing books from a list 
recommended by the SKOLKOVO School of Management each month.
The Bank devotes considerable attention to supporting, developing and improving the status of the 
Kazakh language in the business environment. In 2023, more than 30% of distance learning courses 
were translated into Kazakh. All Bank employees were tested for their knowledge of the Kazakh 
language, with more than 10,000 workers receiving a passing grade. Based on the testing results, 
2,500 employees were offered language training at the Bank’s expense.
In an effort to further develop language practices, the Head Office runs a Kazakh language 
conversation club, which has become not just a platform for communication, but a community of like-
minded people and ambassadors of the Kazakh language.
Staff motivation and loyalty
As a leading employer in the financial sector, Halyk continuously strives to incorporate global 
practices and proven modern techniques into its business management and human resource 
development. While focusing on coordinated teamwork, diligence and the efficiency of each 
employee, the Bank organises a wide range of initiatives that aim to motivate staff and bolster their 
commitment to corporate values. The Bank annually participates in studies on remuneration in the 
banking market to monitor current trends and establish a competitive and fair remuneration system 
that directly affects the recruitment, retention and productivity of employees. In 2023, the Bank 
undertook significant financial measures to support employees, such as the regular indexation of 
15

official salaries in March by an average of 12%, as well as the payment of an annual bonus and a bonus 
to mark Independence Day in Kazakhstan. For the second year in a row, employees were paid 
incentive-based bonuses from shareholder dividends on Halyk Bank common shares in two tranches 
(July and September) to recognise their loyalty, productive work and dedication to the job. The bonus 
for Bank specialists was two times higher than last year. The Bank continues to use a multifunctional 
well-being programme, which in 2023 was supplemented by the official opening of a corporate co-
working area spanning 281 m2. Its main aim is to bring workers together for corporate meetings and 
work presentations in a relaxed atmosphere in order to develop talent and generate new ideas.
The Bank has also created Tribes: cross-functional teams of employees from the Bank’s structural 
units united by a single goal to develop, introduce and launch a product or service for the Bank’s 
customers. To enhance the appeal of participating in Tribes and motivate employees to quickly 
achieve results, principles have been developed to reward Tribe participants based on yearly results 
or the completion of a project, taking into account both the team result and the personal contribution 
of each employee.
As part of the well-being programme to strengthen loyalty, the Bank conducts an annual survey to 
study the degree of employee engagement. The survey results for 2021 and 2022 demonstrated a 
high level of involvement of the Bank’s employees, which exceeded the projected figures by several 
percentage points. And 2023 was no exception: the survey results showed that we once again 
demonstrated substantial growth and exceeded the Bank’s target by five percentage points.
In an effort to bolster the programme for recognising achievements and rewarding the best 
employees, the following measures were taken in 2023: 
○ The format for rewarding the best employees was revised, with the presentation of certificates, 
steles and the payment of bonuses in three categories and a festive award ceremony 
○ The results of the pilot project “Quarterly Recognition of the Bank’s Best Employees” were also 
presented to increase the coverage of effective and key employees
The programme of achievements for Halyk Group managers was expanded. Awards were presented 
in six categories for the best directors of branches by business, the best director of the Head Office 
and the top two managers of subsidiaries.
The Bank’s employees also received state and public awards, including the Tengege 30 medal to mark 
the 30-year anniversary of the Day of the Tenge National Currency, the medal “For Excellence at 
Work”, the medal “Best Financier” and letters of gratitude from the National Bank of Kazakhstan and 
the Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market.
A key component of Halyk’s corporate culture is not only the professional development of its 
employees, but also their physical health. Each year, we organise numerous sporting events. One of 
their key goals is to promote the overall health and well-being of employees, as well as strengthen 
corporate culture. The Bank also devotes significant attention to organising corporate holidays and 
events. We realise that such events play an important role in strengthening cohesion and creating an 
atmosphere of joy and unity. Each year, we arrange various forms of entertainment, hold competitions 
and organise concerts, team building events and much more. We are committed to creating an 
environment for our employees where everyone feels like a valuable and important member of the 
team. These types of events are an essential tool for achieving this goal.
The Bank and its employees are actively involved in socially significant events and projects: 
○ Letters of gratitude were prepared for holidays throughout the year
○ Charitable events were held throughout the year and assistance was provided to the Bank’s retirees 
for the 9 May and 1 October holidays as well as anniversaries 
○ The Bank’s employees visited orphanages (in January, June and September):

For Kazakhstan, 2023 was the year of the ‘new normal’. The overall situation stabilised, inflation 
declined to 9.8% and the economy grew. Banks adapted to life amid sanctions and certainly forewent 
certain transactions due to sanctions restrictions. Nevertheless, Halyk, which celebrated its 
centenary in 2023, once again demonstrated its stability, reliability and solidity and, earned greater 
trust from its customers as a result. Last year, we came a long way in terms of further developing our 
digital sales channels and ecosystem products. The year was also one of 100 good deeds, as Halyk 
implemented major projects throughout the country in education, culture, healthcare, the 
environment and social protection (providing gas to the homes of vulnerable social groups, building 
mini-football fields, providing financial literacy training for the rural population and  holding the Asia 
Dauysy festival, among other initiatives). Our leadership remains solid: as of 1 January 2024, we had 
a market share of 29% by assets, 32.8% by net loans to customers, 30.5% by liabilities to customers 
and 30.0% by net income.
Last year also marked the midpoint of the new strategic development cycle for Halyk Group, covering 
2022-24. While the Group approached the new strategy with different assumptions and market 
expectations, we are staying the course and continuing to progress with our key priorities. Each year, 
we reaffirm the mission we have chosen: “We create a territory of reliability, comfort and trust for our 
customers and partners”. The Group’s reliability and resilience remain our key strengths and we 
remain the first choice for our ever-growing customer base. In 2023, we had 10.2 million active retail 
customers and over 370,000 active large business and SME customers.
During this strategic cycle, the Bank has achieved the following results for its main goals:
Customer focus
All the solutions, products and services being introduced aim to meet the needs of the Bank’s 
customers and provide them with the best possible service. The Bank is focusing on providing 
integrated services based on the ‘one-stop shop’ principle and increasing the loyalty and satisfaction 
of its customers.
In 2023, we introduced new tools for receiving enquiries and assessing customer satisfaction with the 
Bank’s services. Halyk conducted research into market loyalty and gave customers a greater voice in 
determining priorities for the further development of our products and services. This had a positive 
effect on our key quality indicators: the CSI satisfaction index increased from 89% in 2022 to 92% in 
2023, while the average monthly complaint ratio per 10,000 active customers decreased from 6.9 to 
5.5.
Constant growth of the client base, as well as of MAU and DAU
The Bank has prioritised the development of mobile applications, which are used to deliver services 
better, more efficiently and faster. This should increase the number of both total customers and active 
ones who use the applications daily. The Bank is also focusing on expanding non-cash payments.
Results for 2023:
○ Retail banking: We scaled up regular campaigns to retain and engage Halyk SuperApp clients. The 
number of MAU clients increased to 7.9 million in the year (up 2 million), and the MAU share of the 
Bank’s active clients was 77%.
○ Corporate banking: Steps were taken to increase customer activity on Onlinebank. The app 
functionality was enhanced with new digital products and services, and the customer journey was 
improved. MAU continued to grow: up 8% year-on-year (from 254,000 users to 274,000).

Ability to scale business solutions
Given its substantial network of subsidiaries, the Bank plans to develop IT solutions that will allow 
services at subsidiaries to be scaled quickly and with minimal reconfiguration. 
In 2023, Tenge Business, an online business app, continued to develop in Uzbekistan, and had almost 
1,500 active business users by the year-end. The Tenge 24 mobile app for retail customers was 
supplemented with new services: instant transfers from Uzbekistan to Kazakhstan and online 
currency conversion. Last year, the app’s MAU soared to 188,000 users, up 170%.
A flexible, adaptive and innovative approach 
All of our solutions developed must be flexible, universal and modern. The Bank aims to select the best 
IT and business solutions to provide the highest-quality service to its customers, including by 
developing ecosystem services that consider their investment and entertainment interests. 
In 2023, real-time campaigns were launched as part of Data Factory, focusing intensively on 
developing IT solutions while enhancing system availability and service continuity. 
In addition, Halyk implemented several major projects during the year:
○ The Bank initiated a strategic partnership with the leading educational platform Kundelik, as part of 
which Halyk provides bonuses for good grades
○ It began providing digital car loans in partnership with the country’s seven largest car dealers in an 
effort to synergise large and retail businesses
○ Halyk continues to develop ecosystem services: compared with 2022, the Kino.kz movie ticket 
purchase service increased its market share to 37%, ticket purchases through the Halyk Travel 
service rose by 20% and purchases on Halyk Marketplace grew by 170%
○ The Bank is a leader on the financial market in terms of the number of government services it 
provides: in 2023, our customers used government services through the Halyk SuperApp more 
than 13 million times
○ As part of its introduction of ESG principles, KPIs were identified in target areas (water consumption, 
energy, CO2 emissions and more), the public event “Reuse.Recycle.Reduce” was organized jointly 
with the UN, and ESG reporting formats were developed and introduced in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
For 2024, the Bank has set the equally ambitious goals of digitising its banking business and further 
promoting its ecosystem products:
○ Halyk Bank is major partner for most corporates and one of the only full-service banks in 
Kazakhstan. To provide optimal service, the Bank continually enhances the customer experience 
and adds new functionality to the Onlinebank mobile app for corporate customers. 
○ The Halyk SuperApp digital private banking solution is also being continuously developed and 
updated with new services. 
○ Developing the acquiring business continues to be a key vector for the Bank.
○ Given the potential of the Uzbek market, the Bank is actively investing resources and developing in 
this area.
○ The Bank will also continue to enhance and actively promote the lifestyle ecosystem products Kino.
kz (entertainment ticketing) and Halyk Travel (air, rail and bus ticketing). 
○ Halyk Invest, designed for remote brokerage account opening and remote trading, is expanding its 
functionality and improving the customer journey. 
○ The Halyk Marketplace is working to constantly expand the range of products on offer to continue 
meeting customer needs. 
○ The Bank is also implementing several other equally important tasks to provide high-quality service 
to customers and partners.

To the Shareholders of JSC Halyk Bank
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of JSC Halyk Bank and its subsidiaries (the 
“Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, 
and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of other comprehensive 
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the 
year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting 
policy information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and its 
consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”).
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”). Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the 
Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International 
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (the 
“IESBA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements in the Republic of Kazakhstan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to Note 4b to the consolidated financial statements which describes 
therestatement of corresponding figures for theyear ended 31December 2022 and 1 January 2022. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Independent 
Auditors’ Report for 
the Year Ended 31 
December 2023
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
How the matter was addressed in the audit
We obtained an understanding of processes and 
control procedures related to the loan 
origination and ECL for collective assessment of 
loans to customers. 
We challenged the reasonableness of the 
methodology on collective loan loss 
provisioning and its compliance with IFRS 9 
Financial Instruments requirements. 
We checked that the data inputs and key 
assumptions used in the models for assessing 
PDs and LGDs reflect historical information 
about incurred credit losses adjusted for 
relevant forward-looking macroeconomic 
factors.
With the involvement of our credit risk advisory 
specialists, we tested the integrity and 
mathematical accuracy of the ECL credit models 
used by re-performing selective calculations on 
relevant source data. 
We evaluated the adequacy and completeness 
of disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements relating to the loans to customers in 
accordance with IFRS requirements. 
Why the matter was determined to be a key 
audit matter
Collective assessment of the expected credit 
losses on loans to customers
As at 31 December 2023, the Group reported 
total gross loans of KZT 9,774,798 million, 
including KZT 3,824,856 million subject to 
collective impairment assessment, which 
comprise 39% of total gross loans. The 
expected credit losses (“ECL”) resulting from 
this assessment amounted to KZT 235,464 
million.
Due to the significance and subjectivity of 
judgements used by management of the Group 
and the volume of loans assessed on a collective 
basis, we identified the collective assessment of 
expected credit losses as a key audit matter. In 
particular, we focused on the principal 
assumptions and significant inputs underlying 
the estimation of ECL and the integrity of the 
models used in calculations.
Refer to Notes 4, 11 and 32 to the consolidated 
financial statements for the description of the 
Group’s policy and disclosures of gross carrying 
amounts and related allowances balances.

Other Information – Annual Report
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements 
and our auditors’ report thereon. The Annual report is expected to be made available to us after the 
date of this auditors’ report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will 
not express any form of an assurance conclusion thereon.
18
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements and 
Independent 
Auditors’ Report for 
the Year Ended 31 
December 2023
We obtained an understanding of the loan 
origination. We assessed the Group’s definitions 
of significant increase in credit risk and credit-
impairment for assessment of individual loans’ 
ECL. We also evaluated the design and 
implementation of controls related to individual 
assessment of the ECL on loans to customers.
For a sample of loans identified as stage 1, we 
performed a detailed credit review and 
challenged the Group’s analysis of whether 
there was a significant increase in credit risk 
(stage 2) or default (stage 3). In order to evaluate 
whether the loans have been appropriately 
classified to the respective stage, we analysed 
internal credit ratings (scoring), credit risk 
factors and checked if relevant impairment 
events, such as delinquency of interest or 
principal, restructuring events, external 
information and certain financial performance 
indicators had been identified on a timely 
manner.
On a sample basis, we re-performed 
calculations of allowances for ECL for 
individually significant loans in stage 2 and 3, 
including reviewing the Group’s documented 
credit assessment of the borrowers, 
challenging assumptions underlying the ECL 
calculation, such as estimated future cash 
flows and the fair value of collateral.
We evaluated the adequacy and completeness 
of disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements relating to the loans to customers in 
accordance with IFRS requirements.
We obtained an understanding of the controls 
over calculation of insurance contract liabilities 
performed in accordance with IFRS 17 
requirements and Group’s methodology.
We have involved our actuary specialists for 
evaluation of methodology, models and 
assumptions in relation to IFRS 17, considered 
suitability of the transition approach applied and 
tested on a sample basis the accuracy of the 
underlying calculations.
We evaluated whether actuarial methodology, 
models and assumptions used to calculate the 
fulfillment cash flows, risk adjustment, 
contractual service margin, and (if applicable) 
loss component are functioning as intended, 
in line with requirements of IFRS 17 and the 
financial reporting framework as of transition 
date.
Individual assessment of the expected credit 
losses on loans to customers
As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s gross 
loans assessed for impairment on an individual 
basis amounted to KZT 5,949,942 million, 
which accounts for 61% of total gross loans. The 
related ECL comprised KZT 254,462 million.
The amount of allowances for the ECL on 
individually significant loans is dependent on the 
accuracy of allocation of loans to appropriate 
stage of impairment in the provisioning system 
of the Group.
The appropriate identification of significant 
increase in credit risk or credit impairment event 
require considerable judgment on the basis of 
quantitative and qualitative information, which 
results in focused audit procedures. 
Additionally, the measurement of ECL on 
individually significant credit-impaired loans is 
based on the estimation of future cash flows 
under different scenarios.
Due to the significance of the allowance for 
expected credit losses on individually assessed 
loans and the complexity and subjectivity of 
management’s judgements, we identified the 
individual assessment of ECL as a key audit 
matter. 
Refer to Notes 4, 11 and 32 to the consolidated 
financial statements for the description of 
impairment indicators on individually significant 
loans and disclosure of gross carrying amounts 
and related allowances for such loans. 
Transition to IFRS 17
On 1 January 2023, the Group implemented 
IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts. As part of IFRS 17 
implementation, the Group developed and 
implemented new complex methodologies, 
models and assumptions required by new 
standard and remeasured insurance contract 
liabilities. As described in Note 3 and 4b, the 
Group applied Modified Retrospective approach 
and Fair Value approach for contracts issued 
before 1 January 2022.
Due to complexity of methodology and models, 
we identified transition to IFRS 17 as a key audit 
matter.
Refer to Notes 3, 16 and 29 to the consolidated 
financial statements for the description of the 
Group’s accounting policy and disclosures of 
insurance contract liabilities.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the Annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are 
required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), and for such 
internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting 
process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
○ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and 
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
○ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
○ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by management.
○ Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease 
to continue as a going concern.
○ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
○ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan in channeling various budgetary payments and 
pensions through its nationwide branch network. 
The Bank has a primary listing with the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange ("KASE") and Astana International 
Exchange. The Bank's Global Depository Receipts ("GDRs") are primary listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, KASE and Astana International Exchange.
As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group is ultimately controlled by Timur Kulibayev and his wife 
Dinara Kulibayeva via JSC HG Almex. 
As at 31 December 2023, the Bank operated through its head office in Almaty and its 25 regional 
branches, 119 sub-regional offices and 426 cash settlement units  (31 December 2022 – 24, 120 and 
428, respectively) located throughout Kazakhstan. The address of the Bank’s registered office is: 
40 Al-Farabi Avenue, Almaty, A26M3K5, Republic of Kazakhstan.
As at 31 December 2023, the number of the Group’s employees was 16,833 (31 December 2022 – 
16,325). 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023 were 
authorised for issue by the Management Board on 13 March 2024.
Legal proceedings 
From time to time and in the normal course of business, claims against the Group are received from 
customers and counterparties. Management is of the opinion that no material unaccrued losses will 
be incurred and accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements.
Operating environment
Emerging markets such as Kazakhstan are subject to different risks than more developed markets, 
including economic, political and social, and legal and legislative risks. Laws and regulations affecting 
businesses in Kazakhstan continue to change rapidly, tax and regulatory frameworks are subject to 
varying interpretations. The future economic direction of Kazakhstan is heavily influenced by the fiscal 
and monetary policies adopted by the government, together with developments in the legal, 
regulatory, and political environment.
Because Kazakhstan produces and exports large volumes of oil and gas, its economy is particularly 
sensitive to the price of oil and gas on the world market. Also, the government expenses on major 
infrastructure projects and various socio-economic development programs have a significant impact 
on the country’s economy.
The military and political conflict between Russian Federation and Ukraine escalated in early 2022. As 
a result, several countries introduced economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus, including 
measures to ban new investment and restrict interaction with major financial institutions and many 
state enterprises.
In 2023, the average price for Brent crude oil was 83 USD per barrel (2022: 101 USD per barrel). 
According to preliminary estimates, the Kazakhstan’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) grew 
by 4.9% per annum in 2023 (2022: 3.2%). Inflation in the country declined in 2023 to 9.8% per 
annum (2022: inflation was 20.3% per annum). 
In 2023, the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan reduced the base rate from 16.75% to 
15.75% per annum with a corridor of +/- 1.0 percentage points. In January 2024, the base rate further 
decreased to 15.25% per annum with a corridor of +/- 1.0 percentage points, in February 2024, the 
base rate decreased to 14.75% per annum with a corridor of +/- 1.0 percentage points. However, the 
uncertainty still exists related to future development of the geopolitical risks and their impact on the 
economy of Kazakhstan.

The impact of anti-Russian sanctions has a limited impact on the Group's currency risk; risks related 
to Russian securities and Russian banks are intangible in relation to the Group's assets. Claims to 
Russian banks are represented by insignificant amounts of balances on nostro accounts. The gross 
risk in relation to Russian securities and banks is KZT 45,827 million, the net risk is KZT 8,958 million. 
Due to significant changes in the operating environment caused by realized geopolitical risks, an 
extraordinary stress test of the Bank's financial stability was carried out. The stress testing results 
show a slight decrease in certain financial indicators (growth in provisions for expected credit losses, 
decrease in net profit and an outflow of customer funds). At the same time, given that the Group has 
sufficient equity capital and liquid assets, a significant deterioration in the financial position of the 
Group and violation of regulatory requirements and standards is not predicted.
As a result of significant changes in the operating environment, the financial condition of the Bank's 
large borrowers is not expected to deteriorate significantly. The Bank’s clients to larger extend were 
able to make necessary changes to their supply and logistics chains and continue the implementation 
and completion of previously launched investment projects.
Management of the Group is monitoring developments in the economic, political, and geopolitical 
situation and taking measures it considers necessary to support the sustainability and development 
of the Group’s business for the foreseeable future. However, the consequences of these events and 
related future changes may have a significant impact on the Group’s operations.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Group is a going 
concern, as the Group have the resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. In 
making this assessment, the management have considered a wide range of information in relation to 
present and future economic conditions, including projections of cash flows, profit and capital 
resources. 
These consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of Kazakhstani Tenge 
(“KZT” or “Tenge”), except for earnings per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for 
certain financial instruments that are accounted for at fair value and insurance contract liabilities 
which are accounted at their fulfillment value in accordance with IFRS 17 for based on actuarial 
calculations and certain property and equipment which are carried at revalued cost less depreciation 
and impairment as explained in the accounting policies below.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods 
and services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is 
directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an 
asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market 
participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the 
measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated 
financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that 
are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 16, and 
measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable 
value in IAS 2 or value in use in IAS 36.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 
3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the 
significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
○ Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date;
○ Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
○ Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The Group presents its consolidated statement of financial position broadly in order of liquidity. An 
analysis regarding recovery or settlement within 12 months after the date of the consolidated 
statement of financial position (current) and more than 12 months after the date of the consolidated 
statement of financial position (non-current) is presented in Note 31.
Functional currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional 
currency”). The functional currency of the Bank is KZT. The presentation currency of the consolidated 
financial statements is KZT.

Disposal of subsidiaries
On 16 November 2022, the Bank signed an agreement with CJSC International Bank of Tajikistan on 
the sale of 100% share capital of CJSC Halyk Bank Tajikistan (the “HBT”). On 1 December 2022, the 
Bank completed the procedure for the sale of 100% shares of the HBT. The Group recognized a loss in 
the amount of KZT 462 million as a result of disposal of subsidiary.
On 18 November 2022, in accordance with the terms of contract of sale, the Bank sold 100% share 
capital of JSC CB Moskommertsbank (“MKB”) in the amount of 7,923,455 ordinary shares at par 
value RUB 450 per share. On 20 December 2022, the Bank completed the sale of 100% shares of the 
MKB. The Group recognized a loss in the amount of KZT 18,780 million as a result of disposal of 
subsidiary.
Loss from disposal of subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2022 represents the difference 
between the consideration received and the net assets value of subsidiaries in the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group.
Net cash outflows from disposal of JSC CB Moskommertsbank and CJSC Halyk Bank Tajikistan were

3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and entities 
(including structured entities) controlled by the Bank and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when 
the Bank:
○ has power over the investee;
○ is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
○ has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. 
The Bank reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that 
there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. 
When the Bank has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the 
investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant 
activities of the investee unilaterally. The Bank considers all relevant facts and circumstances in 
assessing whether or not the Bank's voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, 
including: 
○  the size of the Bank's holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the 
other vote holders; 
○  potential voting rights held by the Bank, other vote holders or other parties; 
○  rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and 
○  any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Bank has, or does not have, the current 
ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting 
patterns at previous shareholders' meetings.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Bank obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases 
when the Bank loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income from the date the Bank gains control until the date when the Bank 
ceases to control the subsidiary. 
The profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners 
of the Bank and to any non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is 
attributed to the owners of the Bank and to any non-controlling interests even if this results in any non-
controlling interests having a deficit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries to bring their 
accounting policies into line with the Group's accounting policies.
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions 
between members of the Group are eliminated in full upon consolidation.
Changes in the Group's ownership interests in existing subsidiaries
Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing 
control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the 
Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative 
interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in 
equity and attributed to owners of the Group. Transactions with non-controlling shareholders are 
presented as financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss and is 
calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received 
and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including 
goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. All amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the 
Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to 
profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable IFRSs). 
The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is 
regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IFRS 9, when 
applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, unrestricted balances on correspondent 
accounts and amounts due from credit institutions and reverse repo agreements with original 
maturities within three months.

Obligatory reserves 
Obligatory reserves represent funds in correspondent accounts with the National Banks of 
Kazakhstan, Georgia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and cash 
which are not available to finance the Group’s day to day operations and, hence, are not considered as 
part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Amounts due from credit institutions
In the normal course of business, the Group maintains current restricted accounts or deposits for 
various periods of time with other banks. Amounts due from credit institutions with a fixed maturity 
term are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Those that do 
not have fixed maturities are carried at cost. Amounts due from credit institutions are carried net of 
any allowance for expected credit losses.
Recognition and measurement of financial instruments
The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its consolidated statement of financial position 
when it becomes a party to the contractual obligations of the instrument. Regular way purchases and 
sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognised using settlement date accounting. Where 
regular way purchases of financial instruments will be subsequently measured at fair value, the Group 
accounts for any change in the fair value of the asset between trade date and settlement date in the 
same way it accounts for acquired instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted 
from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. 
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss. The accounting policies for 
subsequent re-measurement of these items are disclosed in the respective accounting policies set 
out below.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date where the purchase or sale of 
a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the 
timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus 
transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss 
(“FVTPL”). Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets classified as at 
FVTPL are recognized immediately in profit or loss.
All recognized financial assets that are within the scope of IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” (“IFRS 9”) 
are required to be subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value on the basis of the entity’s 
business model for managing thefinancial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
financial assets.
Specifically:
○ Retention of an asset to obtain the cash flows stipulated by the contract. This business model 
suggests financial asset management aims to realize cash flows by receiving principal and interest 
payments over the life of the financial instrument. Within the framework of this business model, 
holding a financial asset to maturity is a priority, but early disposal is not prohibited.
○ Retention of an asset with a view for obtaining contractual cash flows and sale of financial assets.
This business model assumes that the management of financial assets is aimed at both obtaining 
contractual cash flows and sale of financial assets. Within the framework of this business model, the 
receipt of cash from the sale of a financial asset is a priority, which is characterized by a greater 
frequency and volume of sales compared to "retention of an asset to obtain the cash flows 
stipulated by the contract" business model. 
○ Retention of an asset for other purposes. Within the framework of this business model, financial 
assets can be managed with the following purposes:
 ◦ management with a view to selling cash flows through the sale of financial assets;
 ◦ iquidity management to meet daily funding needs;
 ◦ a portfolio, which management and performance is measured on a fair value basis;
 ◦ a portfolio, which matches the definition of held for trading. Financial assets are deemed to be 
held for trading if they were acquired mainly with a view to subsequent disposal in the near future 
(up to 180 days), gaining short-term profit, or represent derivative financial instruments (except 
for a financial guarantee or derivative financial instrument that was designated as a hedging 
instrument).

In accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets are classified as follows:
○ bank loans classified as assets at amortised cost are contained within the framework of a business 
model which aims to receive cash flows exclusively for repayment of unpaid interest and principal 
stipulated by loan agreement and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (“SPPI”) on the principal amount outstanding;  
○ balances on correspondent accounts, interbank loans/deposits, repo transactions are classified, as 
a rule, as assets, estimated at amortised cost, since they are managed within the framework of a 
business model, which aims to receive cash flows stipulated by the contract, and that have 
contractual cash flows that are SPPI;
○ debt securities may be classified into any of the three classification categories, taking into account 
the selected business model and compliance with the SPPI criterion;
○ equity securities are generally classified as instruments at fair value through profit or loss;
○ trading securities and derivatives are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit orloss.
Financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at FVTPL are:
○ Assets with contractual cash flows that are not SPPI; or/and
○ Assets that are held in abusiness model other than held to collect contractual cash flows or held to 
collect and sell; or
○ Assets designated at FVTPL using the fair value option
○ Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss where the financial liability is 
either held for trading or it is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.  
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
○ it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; or
○ it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and 
has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
○ it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recorded in the 
consolidated statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in net 
(loss)/gain on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Interest earned or 
incurred is accrued in interest income or expense, respectively, according to the terms of the contract, 
while dividend income is recorded in “Other income” when the right to receive the payment has been 
established.
Debt instruments at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(“FVTOCI”)
The Group assesses the classification and measurement of afinancial asset based on the contractual 
cash flow characteristics of the asset and the Group’s business model for managing the asset.
For an asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI, its contractual terms 
should give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
outstanding.
For the purpose of SPPI test, principal is the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition. 
Thatprincipal amount may change over the life of the financial asset (e.g.if there are repayments of 
principal). Interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated 
with the principal amount outstanding during aparticular period of time and for other basic lending 
risks and costs, as well as aprofit margin. The SPPI assessment is made in the currency in which the 
financial asset is denominated.
Contractual cash flows that are SPPI are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Contractual 
terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to 
abasic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity prices or commodity prices, do 
not give rise to contractual cash flows that are SPPI. An originated or an acquired financial asset can 
be abasic lending arrangement irrespective of whether it is aloan in its legal form.
An assessment of business models for managing financial assets is performed at the date of initial 
application of IFRS 9 to determine the classification of afinancial asset. The business model is applied 
retrospectively to all financial assets existing at the date of initial application of IFRS 9. The Group 
determines the business models at alevel that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed 
together to achieve aparticular business objective. The Group’s business model does not depend on 
management’s intentions for an individual instrument; therefore, the business model assessment is 
performed at ahigher level of aggregation rather than on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
The Group has more than one business model for managing its financial instruments that reflect how 
the Group manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The Group’s business models 
determine whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling financial 
assets or both.

The Group considers all relevant information available when making the business model assessment. 
However, this assessment is not performed based on scenarios that the Group does not reasonably 
expect to occur, such as so-called ‘worst case’ or ‘stress case’ scenarios. The Group takes into 
account all relevant evidence available such as:
○ How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business 
model are evaluated and reported to the entity’s key management personnel;
○ The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within 
that business model) and, in particular, the way in which those risks are managed; and
○ How managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether the compensation is based on 
thefair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).
At initial recognition of a financial asset, the Group determines whether newly recognized financial 
assets are part of an existing business model or whether they reflect the commencement of a new 
business model. The Group reassess its business models each reporting period to determine whether 
the business models have changed since the preceding period. For the current reporting period, the 
Group has not identified achange in its business models. 
When a debt instrument measured at FVTOCI is derecognized, the cumulative gain/loss previously 
recognized in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. In contrast, for an equity investment 
designated as measured at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain/loss previously recognized in OCI is not 
subsequently reclassified to profit or loss but transferred within equity. Debt instruments that are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI are subject to impairment.
Reclassification of financial assets 
If the business model under which the Group holds financial assets changes, the financial assets 
affected are reclassified. The classification and measurement requirements related to the new 
category apply prospectively from the first day of the first reporting period following the change in 
business model that result in reclassifying the Group’s financial assets. Changes incontractual cash 
flows are considered under the accounting policy on Modification and derecognition of financial 
assets described below.
Modification and derecognition of financial assets 
A modification of a financial asset occurs when the contractual terms governing the cash flows of 
afinancial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified between initial recognition and maturity of the 
financial asset. A modification affects the amount and/or timing of the contractual cash flows either 
immediately or at afuture date. In addition, the introduction or adjustment of existing covenants of an 
existing loan would constitute amodification even if these new or adjusted covenants do not yet affect 
the cash flows immediately but may affect the cash flows depending on whether the covenant is or is 
not met (e.g.achange to the increase in the interest rate that arises when covenants are breached).
Where possible, the Group seeks to restructure loans rather than to take possession of collateral. This 
may involve extending the payment arrangements and the agreement of new loan conditions. Once 
the terms have been renegotiated, the loan is no longer considered past due. Management 
continuously monitors renegotiated loans to ensure that they are performing and that future 
payments are likely to occur. The loans continue to be subject to an individual or collective impairment 
assessment, calculated using the loan’s original EIR. Renegotiated terms are evidence of impairment 
for loans assessed for impairment on an individual basis, for which deterioration of the financial 
position is observed. 
The Group renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulty to maximize collection and minimize 
the risk of default. A loan forbearance is granted in cases where although the borrower made all 
reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms, there is ahigh risk of default or default 
has already happened and the borrower is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. The revised 
terms in most of the cases include an extension of the maturity of the loan, changes to the timing of 
the cash flows of the loan (principal and interest repayment), reduction in the amount of cash flows 
due (principal and interest forgiveness) and amendments to covenants. The Group has an established 
forbearance policy, which applies for corporate and retail lending.
When a financial asset is modified the Group assesses whether this modification results 
inderecognition. In accordance with the Group’s policy amodification results in derecognition when 
it gives rise to substantially different terms. To determine if the modified terms are substantially 
different from the original contractual terms the Group considers qualitative factors, such as 
contractual cash flows after modification are no longer SPPI, change in currency or change of 
counterparty, the extent of change in interest rates, maturity, covenants. 
When a financial asset is modified due to commercial reasons, the Group considers various qualitative 
factors (change in currency, interest rate, maturity) and on that basis concludes whether old loan 
should be derecognised and new loan should be recognised at fair value.
In the case where the financial asset is derecognized the loss allowance for ECL is remeasured at the 
date of derecognition to determine the net carrying amount of the asset at that date. The difference 
between this revised carrying amount and the fair value of the new financial asset with the new terms 
will lead to a gain or loss on derecognition. The new financial asset will have a loss allowance 
measured based on 12-month ECL except in the rare occasions where the new loan is considered to 
be originated credit-impaired asset. This applies only in the case where the fair value of the new loan

is recognized at asignificant discount to its revised par amount because there remains ahigh risk of 
default, which has not been reduced by the modification. Please also refer to Note 11 for more details. 
Impairment 
Calculation of financial assets impairment is carried out taking into account the following factors:
○ In order to calculate the ECL, the Bank performs a loan assessment on an individual basis and on a 
group basis depending on general credit risk features.
○ ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of the present value of credit losses. These are measured 
as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the Group under the contract 
and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive arising from the weighting of multiple future 
economic scenarios, discounted at the asset’s EIR.
○ Calculations are based on justified and verified information, which may be received without any 
significant costs or efforts. Calculation of the present value of the expected future cash flows of the 
secured financial asset reflects the cash flow that may result from foreclosure, less the cost of 
obtaining and selling collateral, regardless of whether the recovery is probable or not. The 
allowance is based on the Group's own experience in assessing losses and management 
assumptions about the level of losses likely to be recognised on assets in each category of a credit 
risk, based on debt servicing capabilities and borrower's credit track record.
○ Impairment for treasury operations (investments in debt securities, reverse repurchase 
transactions, interbank loans and deposits, correspondent account transactions, accounts 
receivable under treasury transactions) is calculated taking into account the counterparty's rating, 
probability of default, duration of a transaction and the extent of loss in case of a default.
○ The estimated credit losses for treasury operations are estimated on an individual basis (except for 
individual claims in the form of receivables).
Financial assets are segmented by stages in accordance with the following approach:
○ Stage 1: There is no significant increase in credit risk since recognition of an asset, impairment is 
recognised as expected losses over the next 12 months;
○ Stage 2: Significant increase in credit risk since recognition of an asset, impairment is recognised as 
expected losses over the life of a financial asset;
○ Stage 3: Financial asset is in default or has signs of impairment. 
Allowances for expected credit losses
ECLs are required to be measured through aloss allowance at an amount equal to:
○ 12-month ECL, i.e.lifetime ECL that result from those default events on the financial instrument that 
are possible within 12months after the reporting date, (referred to as Stage 1); or
○ Full lifetime ECL, i.e. lifetime ECL that result from all possible default events over the life of the 
financial instrument, (referred to as Stage 2 and Stage 3). 
For more details about staging refer to Notes 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11.
A loss allowance for full lifetime ECL is required for a financial instrument if the credit risk on that 
financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. For all other financial 
instruments, ECLs are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL. 
○ For undrawn loan commitments, the ECL is the difference between the present value of the 
difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group if the holder of the 
commitment draws down the loan and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive if the loan 
is drawn down; and
○ For financial guarantee contracts, the ECL is the difference between the expected payments to 
reimburse the holder of the guaranteed debt instrument less any amounts that the Group expects 
to receive from the holder, the debtor or any other party.
The Group measures ECL on an individual basis, or on a collective basis for portfolios of loans that 
share similar risk characteristics. The measurement of the loss allowance is based on the present 
value of the asset’s expected cash flows using the asset’s original effective interest rate (“EIR”), 
regardless of whether it is measured on an individual basis or acollective basis.
Critical to the determination of ECL is the definition of default. The definition of default is used in 
measuring the amount of ECL and in the determination of whether the loss allowance is based 
on 12-month or lifetime ECL, as default is acomponent of the probability of default, which affects both 
the measurement of ECLs and the identification of asignificant increase in credit risk. Please also refer 
to Note 4 for more details.

Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement 
of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. In accounting for a transfer of a financial asset that does not qualify for derecognition, 
the Group does not offset the transferred asset and the associated liability. Income and expense is not 
offset in the consolidated statement of profit or loss unless required or permitted by any accounting 
standard or interpretation, and as specifically disclosed in the accounting policies of the Group.
Credit-impaired financial assets 
A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have adetrimental impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Credit-impaired financial assets are 
referred to as Stage 3 assets. Evidence of credit-impairment includes observable data about the 
following events:
○ significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
○ a breach of contract such as adefault or past due event;
○ the lender of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial 
difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise 
consider;
○ the disappearance of an active market for asecurity because of financial difficulties; or
○ the purchase of afinancial asset at adeep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.
It may not be possible to identify asingle discrete event instead; the combined effect of several events 
may have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired. The Group assesses whether debt 
instruments that are financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are credit-impaired at 
each reporting date. To assess if sovereign and corporate debt instruments are credit impaired, the 
Group considers factors such as bond yields, credit ratings and the ability of the borrower to raise 
funding.
A loan is considered credit-impaired when a concession is granted to the borrower due to 
a deterioration in the borrower’s financial condition, unless there is evidence that as a result of 
granting the concession the risk of not receiving the contractual cash flows has reduced significantly 
and there are no other indicators of impairment. For financial assets where concessions are 
contemplated but not granted, the asset is deemed credit impaired when there is observable evidence 
of credit-impairment including meeting the definition of default. The definition of default includes 
unlikeliness to pay indicators and abackstop if amounts are overdue for 90days or more. The decision 
to use cross-default is based on case-by-case assessment of client’s facility conditions such as 
collateral and materiality of exposure.
Purchased or originated credit-impaired (“POCI”) financial assets
POCI financial assets are treated differently because the asset is credit-impaired at initial recognition. 
For these assets, the Group recognizes all changes in lifetime ECL since initial recognition as a loss 
allowance with any changes recognized in profit or loss. A favorable change for such assets creates 
an impairment gain (recovery of credit loss expense).
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets 
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or a part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is derecognised where:
○ the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
○ the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset, or retained the right to 
receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material 
delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and
○ the Group either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
A financial asset is derecognised when it has been transferred and the transfer qualifies for 
derecognition. A transfer requires that the Group either: (a) transfers the contractual rights to receive 
the asset’s cash flows; or (b) retains the right to the asset’s cash flows but assumes a contractual 
obligation to pay those cash flows to a third party. After a transfer, the Group reassesses the extent to 
which it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset. If substantially all the 
risks and rewards have been retained, the asset remains on the consolidated statement of financial 
position. If substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred, the asset is derecognised. 
If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred, the Group 
assesses whether or not it has retained control of the asset. If it has not retained control, the asset is 
derecognised. Where the Group has retained control of the asset, it continues to recognise the asset 
to the extent of its continuing involvement.

Modification and derecognition of financial liabilities 
The Group derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial 
liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.
When the Group exchanges with the existing lender one debt instrument into another one with 
substantially different terms, such exchange is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original 
financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, the Group accounts for 
substantial modification of terms of an existing liability or part of it as an extinguishment of the original 
financial liability and the recognition of a new liability. It is assumed that the terms are substantially 
different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees 
paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original effective rate is at least 10 per cent 
different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial 
liability. If the modification is not substantial, the difference between: (1) the carrying amount of the 
liability before the modification; and (2) the present value of the cash flows after modification should 
be recognised in profit or loss as the modification gain or loss within other gains and losses.
Taxation
The current income tax expense is calculated in accordance with the regulations of Kazakhstan and 
other countries where the Group operates. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting 
purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it 
relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can 
be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset and reported net in the consolidated 
statement of financial position if:
○ The Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets against current income 
tax liabilities; and
○ Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.
Kazakhstan and other countries where the Group operates also have various operating taxes that are 
assessed on the Group’s activities. These taxes are recorded as taxes other than income tax. 
The Group records a provision for uncertain tax positions if it is probable that the Group will have to 
make a payment to tax authorities upon their examination of a tax position. This provision is measured 
at the Group's best estimate of the amount expected to be paid. Provisions are reversed to income in 
provision for (recovery of) income taxes in the period in which management determines they are no 
longer required or as determined by statute.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment, except for any buildings and construction which are carried at revalued amount, being 
the fair value at the date of the revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and 
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying amounts of property and equipment are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Buildings and construction held for use in supply of services, or for administrative purposes, are 
stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at their revalued amounts, being the fair 
value at the date of revaluation, determined from market-based evidence by appraisal undertaken by 
professional independent appraisers, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and 
subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations are performed with sufficient regularity 
such that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using 
fair values at the reporting date.

135
Any revaluation increase arising on the revaluation of such buildings and construction is credited to 
the property revaluation reserve, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease for the 
same asset previously recognised as an expense, in which case the increase is credited to the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss to the extent of the decrease previously charged. A decrease 
in the carrying amount arising on the revaluation of such buildings and construction is charged as an 
expense to the extent that it exceeds the balance, if any, held in the property revaluation reserve 
relating to a previous revaluation of that asset.
Depreciation on revalued buildings and construction is charged to the consolidated statement of 
profit or loss. On the subsequent sale or retirement of a revalued property, the attributable revaluation 
surplus remaining in the property revaluation reserve is transferred directly to retained earnings. 
Construction in progress is carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes 
professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policy. Such construction in progress is classified to the appropriate categories of 
property and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, 
on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their 
intendeduse.
An item of property and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the 
disposal or retirement of an item of property and equipment is determined as the difference between 
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss. 
Assets held for sale
Non-current assets and the liabilities directly associated with non-current assets are classified as held 
for sale (“disposal group”) if it is highly probable that the net asset’s carrying amount will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and the asset (or disposal group) is 
available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, 
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date 
of classification of an asset as held for sale.
Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
If the fair value less costs to sell of an asset held for sale is lower than its carrying amount, an 
impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any subsequent increase in an asset’s fair value less 
costs to sell is recognised to the extent of the cumulative impairment loss that was previously 
recognised in profit or loss in relation to that specific asset. 
Investment property
Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment 
properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investment properties are measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair 
value of investment properties are included in profit or loss in the year in which they arise.
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is 
permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the year in 
which the property is derecognised. 
Commercial property 
In certain circumstances, the Group may foreclose commercial properties as part of the settlement of 
loan agreements with customers. The Group intends to sell these properties in the normal course of 
business and therefore these are initially measured at fair value including transaction costs and 
subsequently measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Estimates of net realisable value 
are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made, of the amount 
the commercial property is expected to be realised for. These estimates take into consideration 
fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after the end of the year to the extent 
that such events confirm conditions existing at the end of the year.
Amounts due to customers and credit institutions
Amounts due to customers and credit institutions are initially recognised at the fair value of the 
consideration received, less directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, amounts due are 
stated at amortised cost and any difference between net proceeds and the redemption value is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the 
effective interest method. If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the consolidated 
statement of financial position and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the 
consideration paid is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Debt securities issued
Debt securities issued represent bonds issued by the Group, which are accounted for according to the 
same principles used for amounts due to customers and credit institutions. Any difference between 
proceeds received, net of debt issuance costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest 
method.

Equity
The Group classifies a financial instrument that it issues as a financial asset, financial liability or an 
equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. An instrument is 
classified as a liability if it is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset, or to 
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities on potentially unfavourable terms. An instrument is 
classified as equity if it evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group, after the deduction of 
liabilities. 
The components of a compound financial instrument issued by the Group are classified and 
accounted for separately as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments as appropriate.  
Share capital 
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than in a business combination, 
are shown as a deduction from the proceeds in equity. Prior to 13 May 2003, any excess of the fair 
value of consideration received over the nominal value of shares issued was recognised as share 
premium reserve. Effective 13 May 2003, upon a change in the law concerning “Joint Stock 
Companies”, the nominal amount concept was restricted to placement of shares only between the 
founders of an entity. For all other investors, share capital is recorded at placement value being the 
consideration received by an entity for its shares.
Treasury shares 
When the Group acquires its own share capital, the amount of the consideration paid, including 
directly attributable costs, net of any related tax benefit, is recognised as a change in equity. 
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are held at cost. These shares are treated as 
a deduction from the issued and weighted average number of shares, and the cost price of the shares 
is presented as a deduction from total equity. Dividends on shares purchased by the Group’s 
subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation.
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity on the date they are declared. 
Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the reporting date or proposed or declared 
after the reporting date but before the consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue.
Equity reserves
The reserves recorded in equity (other comprehensive income) on the Group’s consolidated 
statement of financial position include:
○ Revaluation reserve of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income which 
comprises changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income and allowances for expected credit losses on debt financial assets at fair value through 
other comprehensive income;
○ Cumulative translation reserve which is used to record foreign exchange differences arising from 
the translation of the net investment in foreign operations;
○ Property revaluation reserve, which comprises revaluation reserve of land and buildings.
Contingencies
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but are 
disclosed unless the possibility of any outflow in settlement is remote. A contingent asset is not 
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but disclosed when an inflow of 
economic benefits is probable.  
Recognition of income and expense
Interest income and expense for all financial instruments, except for financial assets measured or 
designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in ‘Net interest income’ as ‘Interest 
income calculated using the effective interest method’ and ‘Interest expense’ in the profit or loss 
account using the effective interest method. 
Interest income on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss is included in 
‘Other interest income’ in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows of the financial instrument 
through the expected life of the financial instrument or, where appropriate, ashorter period, to the net 
carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The future cash flows are estimated taking 
into account all the contractual terms of the instrument.
The calculation of the EIR includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract 
that are incremental and directly attributable to the specific lending arrangement, transaction costs, 
and all other premiums or discounts. For financial assets at FVTPL transaction costs are recognized 
inprofit or loss at initial recognition.

137
The interest income/interest expense is calculated by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount 
ofnon-credit impaired financial assets (i.e.at the amortised cost of the financial asset before adjusting 
for any expected credit loss allowance), or to the amortised cost of financial liabilities. For credit-
impaired financial assets, the interest income is calculated by applying the EIR to the amortised cost 
ofthe credit-impaired financial assets (i.e.the gross carrying amount less the allowance for expected 
credit losses). For financial assets POCI the EIR reflects the expected credit losses in determining the 
future cash flows expected to be received from the financial asset.
Loan origination fees for loans issued to customers are (together with related direct costs) recognised 
as an adjustment to the effective yield of the loans. Where it is probable that a loan commitment will 
lead to a specific lending arrangement, the loan commitment fees are deferred, together with the 
related direct costs, and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate of the resulting 
loan. Where it is unlikely that a loan commitment will lead to a specific lending arrangement, the loan 
commitment fees are recognised in profit or loss over the remaining period of the loan commitment. 
Where a loan commitment expires without resulting in a loan, the loan commitment fee is recognised 
in profit or loss on expiry.
Fee and commission income 
Fee and commission income is recognised to reflect the transfer of services to customers at an 
amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for such services. 
The Group identifies the performance obligation, i.e. the services agreed with the customer, and the 
consideration, and recognises income in line with the transfer of services, the performance obligation, 
agreed with the customer.
For each performance obligation identified, the Group determines at contract inception whether it 
satisfies the performance obligation over time or at a point in time, and whether the consideration is 
fixed or variable, including whether consideration is constrained by, for instance, external factors 
outside the Group’s influence. The consideration is subsequently allocated to the identified 
performance obligation.
Fee and commission income from maintenance of customer accounts and cash operations include 
fees earned from deposit products in lieu of compensating balances, service charges for transactions 
performed upon depositors’ request, as well as fees earned from performing cash management 
activities. Service charges on deposit products are recognized over the period in which the related 
service is provided, typically monthly. Service fees are recognized at a point in time upon completion 
of the requested service transaction. Fees on cash management products are recognized over time as 
services are provided.
Plastic cards operations fee and commission income include interchange income from credit and 
debit card transactions and are recognized at a point in time upon settlement by the associated 
network. Interchange rates are generally set by the associated network based on purchase volume 
and other factors. Other card-related fees are recognized at a point in time upon completion of the 
transaction. 
Other banking fees include fees for various transactional banking activities such as bank transfers, 
letters of credit fees and other transactional services. These fees are recognized in a manner that 
reflects the timing of when transactions occur and as services are provided. Letter of credit fees 
primarily includes fees received related to letter of credit agreements and are generally recognized 
upon execution of the contract.
The adoption of IFRS 15 has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts 
reported in the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in KZT, which is the functional currency of the 
Bank and each of its subsidiaries, except for foreign subsidiaries. Transactions in foreign currencies 
are initially recorded in the functional currency, converted at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the currency rate of exchange as quoted by KASE as at the reporting date. Gains and losses resulting 
from the translation of foreign currency transactions into functional currency are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss as net foreign exchange gain or loss. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates 
as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into the 
Group’s presentation currency at the exchange rates as at the consolidated statement of financial 
position date, and their statements of profit or loss are translated at the average exchange rates for the 
year. Exchange differences arising on translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity. 
On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to 
that particular foreign operation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Differences between the contractual exchange rate of a transaction in a foreign currency and the 
market exchange rate on the date of the transaction are included in net foreign exchange gain or loss. 
The market exchange rate at 31 December 2023 was – KZT 454.56 to USD, KZT 5.06 to RUB, KZT 
502.24 to EUR (at 31 December 2022 was – KZT 462.65 to USD, KZT 6.43 to RUB, KZT 492.86 to EUR).

Insurance contracts
On 1 January 2023, the Group implemented IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts. 
A. Key types of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held
The Group issues the following types of contracts that are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 17 
Insurance Contracts.
Life business – non-participating contracts including:
○ Term life insurance contracts providing level or decreasing sum assured coverage for a limited 
period of time in exchange for non-renewable fixed premiums.
This group of contracts include the following material products of the Group – voluntary 
accumulative life insurance Kazyna, voluntary accumulative life insurance Baiterek, voluntary 
accumulative life insurance Bolashak Life, and others. 
○ Fixed annuity contracts providing the annuitant with a guaranteed income payout for life.
This group of contracts include the following material products of the Group – pension annuity and 
annuities under employer liability. The Group accounts for these policies applying the General 
Model.
Motor and property insurance policies:
These comprise comprehensive and third-party liability car insurance policies as well as property 
insurance policies for contents and buildings and other properties with coverage of one year or more.
This group of contracts include the following material products of the Group – voluntary life insurance 
Halyk Retail, voluntary life insurance Halyk Small Business, and obligatory insurance of an employee 
against accidents during the performance of his work duties, voluntary life insurance Halyk Eurasia, 
health insurance, and obligatory liability insurance for vehicle owners, property insurance, motor 
transport and liability insurance.
The Group accounts for these contracts applying the Premium Allocation Approach (PAA).
B. Definitions and classifications
Products sold by the Group are classified as insurance contracts when the Group accepts significant 
insurance risk from a policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain 
future event adversely affects the policyholder.
This assessment is made on a contract-by-contract basis at the contract issue date. In making this 
assessment, the Group considers all its substantive rights and obligations, whether they arise from 
contract, law or regulation. The Group determines whether a contract contains significant insurance 
risk by assessing if an insured event could cause the Group to pay to the policyholder additional 
amounts that are significant in any single scenario with commercial substance even if the insured 
event is extremely unlikely or the expected present value of the contingent cash flows is a small 
proportion of the expected present value of the remaining cash flows from the insurance contract.
C. Combining a set or series of contracts
Sometimes, the Group enters into two or more contracts at the same time with the same or related 
counterparties to achieve an overall commercial effect. The Group accounts for such a set of 
contracts as a single insurance contract when this reflects the substance of the contracts. When 
making this assessment, the Group considers whether:
○ The rights and obligations are different when looked at together compared to when looked at 
individually
○ The Group is unable to measure one contract without considering the other
D. Separating components from insurance and reinsurance contracts
In addition to the provision of the insurance coverage service, some insurance contracts issued by the 
Group have other components such as an investment component.
The Group assesses its products to determine whether some of these components are distinct and 
need to be separated and accounted for applying other IFRS Accounting Standards. When these non-
insurance components are non-distinct, they are accounted for together with the insurance 
component applying IFRS 17.
Separating investment components
The Group issues certain life insurance policies. These include an investment component under which 
the Group is required to repay to a policyholder in all circumstances, regardless of an insured event 
occurring. In assessing whether an investment component is distinct and therefore required to be 
accounted for separately applying IFRS 9, the Group considers if the investment and insurance 
components are highly interrelated or not. A contract with equivalent terms to the investment 
component is sold (or could be sold) separately in the same market or in the same jurisdiction by other 
entities, including those issuing insurance contracts.

When the investment component meets the definition of an investment contract with discretionary 
participation features, it is then accounted for applying IFRS 17. In determining whether investment 
and insurance components are highly interrelated the Group assesses whether the Group is unable to 
measure one component without considering the other and whether the policyholder is unable to 
benefit from one component unless the other component is present, i.e. whether cancelling one 
component also terminates the other. The Group has not identified any distinct investment 
components. The Group applies IFRS 17 to account for non-distinct investment components as part 
of its insurance contracts.
Separating insurance components of a single insurance contract
Once investment components are separated, the Group assesses whether the contract should be 
separated into several insurance components that, in substance, should be treated as separate 
contracts to reflect the substance of the transaction. To determine whether insurance components 
should be recognised and measured separately, the Group considers whether there is an 
interdependency between the different risks covered, whether components can lapse independently 
of each other and whether the components can be priced and sold separately. When the Group enters 
into one legal contract with different insurance components operating independently of each other, 
insurance components are recognised and measured separately applying IFRS 17.
E. Level of aggregation
The Group identifies portfolios by aggregating insurance contracts that are subject to similar risks and 
managed together. In grouping insurance contracts into portfolios, the Group considers the similarity 
of risks rather than the specific labelling of product lines. The Group has determined that all contracts 
within each product line, as defined for management purposes, have similar risks. Therefore, when 
contracts are managed together, they represent a portfolio of contracts. Some products issued by 
different entities within the Group are considered as being managed at the issuing entity level. This is 
because the management of the solvency capital management, which supports the issuance of these 
contracts, is ring-fenced within these entities.
Each portfolio is subdivided into groups of contracts to which the recognition and measurement 
requirements of IFRS 17 are applied. At initial recognition, the Group segregates contracts based on 
when they were issued. A cohort contains all contracts that were issued within a 12-month period. 
Each cohort is then further disaggregated into two groups of contracts:
○ Contracts that are onerous on initial recognition
○ Contracts that, on initial recognition, have no significant possibility of becoming onerous 
subsequently
The determination of whether a contract or a group of contracts is onerous is based on the 
expectations as at the date of initial recognition, with fulfilment cash flow expectations determined on 
a probability-weighted basis. The Group determines the appropriate level at which reasonable and 
supportable information is available to assess whether the contracts are onerous at initial recognition 
and whether the contracts not onerous at initial recognition have a significant possibility of becoming 
onerous subsequently. The Group applies significant judgement in determining at what level of 
granularity the Group has sufficient information to conclude that all contracts within a set will be in the 
same group. In the absence of such information, the Group assesses each contract individually.
The composition of groups established at initial recognition is not subsequently reassessed. See Note 
1.M below for the accounting policy on levels of aggregation for contracts that existed as at the 
transition date to IFRS 17.
For motor and property insurance contracts accounted for applying the PAA, the Group determines 
that contracts are not onerous on initial recognition, unless there are facts and circumstances 
indicating otherwise. The Group assesses the likelihood of changes in applicable facts and 
circumstances to determine whether contracts not onerous on initial recognition belong to a group 
with no significant possibility of becoming onerous in the future. If facts and circumstances indicate 
that some contracts may be onerous at initial recognition or the group of contracts has become 
onerous, the Group performs a quantitative assessment to assess whether the carrying amount of the 
liability for remaining coverage determined applying the PAA is less than the fulfilment cash flows 
related to remaining coverage determined applying the General Model. If the fulfilment cash flows 
related to remaining coverage determined applying the General Model exceed the PAA carrying 
amount of the liability for remaining coverage, the difference is recognised in profit or loss and the 
liability for remaining coverage is increased by the same amount.
When motor insurance contracts within a portfolio would only fall into different groups due to specific 
constraints imposed by law or regulation on the Group’s practical ability to set a different price or level 
of benefits for male and female policyholders, the Group nevertheless includes those contracts in the 
same group.
F. Recognition
The Group recognises groups of insurance contracts issued from the earliest of the following dates:
○ The beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts
○ The date when the first payment from a policyholder in the group becomes due (in the absence of a 
contractual due date, this is deemed to be when the first payment is received)
○ The date when a group of contracts becomes onerous

The Group recognises only contracts issued within a one-year period meeting the recognition criteria 
by the reporting date. Subject to this limit, a group of insurance contracts can remain open after the 
end of the current reporting period. New contracts are included in the group when they meet the 
recognition criteria in subsequent reporting periods until such time that all contracts expected to be 
included within the group have been recognised. Investment contracts with discretionary 
participation features are initially recognised at the date the Group becomes a party to the contract.
G. Contract boundaries
The measurement of a group of insurance contracts includes all future cash flows expected to arise 
within the boundary of each contract in the group. In determining which cash flows fall within a 
contract boundary, the Group considers its substantive rights and obligations arising from the terms 
of the contract, and from applicable laws, regulations and customary business practices. The Group 
determines that cash flows are within the boundary of a contract if they arise from substantive rights 
and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the Group can compel the policyholder 
to pay the premiums or the Group has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with 
insurance contract services. A substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services ends 
when the Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of a particular policyholder and, as a 
result, to change the price charged or the level of benefits provided for the price to fully reflect the new 
level of risk. If the boundary assessment is performed at a portfolio rather than individual contract 
level, the Group must have the practical ability to reprice the portfolio to fully reflect risk from all 
policyholders. The Group’s pricing must not take into account any risks beyond the next reassessment 
date.
In determining whether all risks have been reflected either in the premium or in the level of benefits, 
the Group considers all risks that policyholders would transfer had the Group issued the contracts (or 
portfolio of contracts) at the reassessment date. Similarly, the Group concludes on its practical ability 
to set a price that fully reflects the risks in the contract or portfolio at a renewal date by considering all 
the risks it would assess when underwriting equivalent contracts on the renewal date for the 
remaining service. The assessment on the Group’s practical ability to reprice existing contracts takes 
into account all contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions. In doing so, the Group disregards 
restrictions that have no commercial substance. The Group also considers the impact of market 
competitiveness and commercial considerations on its practical ability to price new contracts and 
repricing existing contracts. The Group exercises judgement in deciding whether such commercial 
considerations are relevant in concluding as to whether the practical ability exists at the 
reportingdate.
In estimating expected future cash flows of a group of contracts, the Group applies judgement in 
assessing future policyholder behaviour surrounding the exercise of options available to them. These 
include surrender options, and other options falling within the contract boundary.
Cash flows are within the boundaries of investment contracts with discretionary participation features 
if they result from a substantive obligation of the Group to deliver cash at a present or future date.
The Group assesses the contract boundary at initial recognition and at each subsequent reporting 
date to include the effect of changes in circumstances on the Group’s substantive rights and 
obligations.
H. Measurement of insurance contracts issued
H1. Measurement on initial recognition for contracts other than PAA
The Group measures a group of contracts on initial recognition as the sum of the expected fulfilment 
cash flows within the contract boundary and the contractual service margin representing the 
unearned profit in the contracts relating to services that will be provided under the contracts.
Fulfilment cash flows within contract boundary
The fulfilment cash flows are the best estimates of the present value of the future cash flows, including 
a risk adjustment for non-financial risk. The estimates of future cash flows reflect conditions existing 
at the measurement date including assumptions at that date about the future.
The Group estimates expected future cash flows for a group of contracts at a portfolio level and 
allocates them to the groups in that portfolio in a systematic and rational way. When estimating future 
cash flows, the Group includes all cash flows within the contract boundary including:
○ Premiums and any additional cash flows resulting from those premiums;
○ Reported claims that have not yet been paid, claims incurred but not yet reported, future claims 
expected to arise from the policy and potential cash inflows from recoveries on future claims 
covered by existing insurance contracts;
○ An allocation of insurance acquisition cash flows attributable to the portfolio to which the issued 
contract belongs;
○ Claim handling costs;
○ Policy administration and maintenance costs including recurring commissions expected to be paid 
to intermediaries for policy administration services only (recurring commissions that are insurance 
acquisition cash flows are treated as such in the estimate of future cash flows)

○ An allocation of fixed and variable overheads directly attributable to the fulfilment of insurance 
contracts including overhead costs such as accounting, human resources, information technology 
and support, building depreciation, rent, and maintenance and utilities
○ Other costs specifically chargeable to the policyholder under the terms of the contract
See Note 16 for fulfilment cash flows of reinsurance contracts held.
Discount rates
The time value of money and financial risk is measured separately from expected future cash flows 
with changes in financial risks recognised in profit or loss at the end of each reporting period unless 
the Group has elected the accounting policy to present the time value of money separately in profit or 
loss. The Group measures the time value of money using discount rates that reflect the liquidity 
characteristics of the insurance contracts and the characteristics of the cash flows, consistent with 
observable current market prices. They exclude the effect of factors that influence such observable 
market prices but do not affect the future cash flows of the insurance contracts (e.g. credit risk).
Expected future cash flows that vary based on the returns on any financial underlying items are 
discounted at rates that reflect this variability.
A mix of the bottom-up and top-down approaches was applied in the determination of the discount 
rates for different products. Bottom-up approach is used for cash flows denominated in foreign 
currencies. Top-down approach is used for cash flows denominated in KZT. Discount rates 
determined at the reporting date are disclosed in Note 16.
Risk adjustment for non-financial risk
The Group measures the compensation it would require for bearing the uncertainty about the amount 
and timing of cash flows arising from insurance contracts, other than financial risk, separately as an 
adjustment for non-financial risk. In calculating the risk adjustment coefficient, the impact of the 
following actuarial assumptions on the level of insurance risk is taken into account:
○ Probability of death by sex and age;
○ Amount of administrative expenses;
○ Probability of termination (if any);
○ Probability of prolongation.
The calculation is made using the Value at Risk (VaR) method. Under this approach, the Group 
calculates the present value of future cash flows under a number of different scenarios (each scenario 
representing uncertainty resulting from non-financial risks) in order to reproduce the distribution of 
risks. The risk adjustment for non-financial risk is taken to be equal to the difference between the cost 
measure of risk at a given level of confidence and the average value - its best estimate.The reliability 
equal to 75% are accepted.
Contractual service margin (CSM)
The CSM is a component of the overall carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts 
representing unearned profit that the Group will recognise as it provides insurance contract services 
over the coverage period.
At initial recognition, the Group measures the CSM at an amount that, unless a group of insurance 
contracts is onerous, results in no gains recognised in profit or loss arising from:
○ The expected fulfilment cash flows of the group
○ The amount of any derecognised asset for insurance acquisition cash flows allocated to the group
○ Any other asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group
○ Any cash flows that have already arisen on the contracts as of that date
If a group of contracts is onerous, the Group recognises a loss on initial recognition. This results in the 
carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal to the fulfilment cash flows, and the CSM of 
the group being nil. A loss component is recognised for any loss on initial recognition of the group of 
insurance contracts. See Note 16.
The Group determines at initial recognition the group’s coverage units. The Group then allocates the 
group’s CSM based on the coverage units provided in the period.
Insurance acquisition cash flows
The Group includes insurance acquisition cash flows in the measurement of a group of insurance 
contracts if they are directly attributable to either the individual contracts in a group, the group itself 
or the portfolio of insurance contracts to which the group belongs.
The Group estimates, at a portfolio level, insurance acquisition cash flows not directly attributable to 
the group but directly attributable to the portfolio. The Group then allocates them to the group of 
newly written and renewed contracts on a systematic and rational basis.

142
The Group recognises an asset in respect of costs to secure a portfolio or group of insurance 
contracts, such as costs of selling and underwriting, when these costs are incurred before the 
recognition of the group of insurance contracts to which these costs relate. The Group recognises 
such an asset for each existing or future group of insurance contracts to which insurance acquisition 
cash flows are allocated. The related portion of the asset for insurance acquisition cash flows is 
derecognised and included in the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows of the associated group 
of contracts when the group is initially recognised. When only some of the insurance contracts 
expected to be included within the group are recognised as at the end of the reporting period, the 
Group determines the related portion of the asset that is derecognised and included in the group’s 
fulfilment cash flows. The related portion is determined on a systematic and rational allocation 
method that considers the timing of recognition of the contracts in the group.
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of the asset for insurance acquisition 
cash flows to determine whether there is an indication that the asset has suffered an impairment. If 
any such indication exists, the Group adjusts the carrying amount of the asset so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed the expected net cash inflow for the associated future groups of 
contracts. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss for the difference. Where an impairment 
loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the extent the impairment 
conditions no longer exist or have improved and the cumulative amount of impairment loss reversal 
does not exceed the impairment loss recognised for the asset in prior years.
H.2 Subsequent measurement under the General Model
In estimating the total future fulfilment cash flows, the Group distinguishes between those relating to 
already incurred claims and those relating to future service. At the end of each reporting period, the 
carrying amount of the group of insurance contracts will reflect a current estimate of the liability for 
remaining coverage (LRC) as at that date and a current estimate of the liability for incurred claims 
(LIC). The LRC represents the Group’s obligation to investigate and pay valid claims under existing 
contracts for insured events that have not yet occurred, amounts that relate to other insurance 
contract services not yet provided (i.e. provision of investment-return and investment-related 
services) and investment components and other amounts not related to insurance contract services 
that have not yet been transferred to the LIC. The LRC is comprised of (a) the fulfilment cash flows 
relating to future service, (b) the CSM yet to be earned and (c) any outstanding premiums for 
insurance contract services already provided.
The LIC includes the Group’s liability to pay valid claims for insured events that have already incurred, 
other incurred insurance expenses arising from past coverage service and the liability for claims 
incurred but not yet reported. It also includes the Group’s liability to pay amounts the Group is obliged 
to pay the policyholder under the contract. This includes repayment of investment components, when 
a contract is derecognised. The current estimate of LIC comprises the fulfilment cash flows related to 
current and past service allocated to the group at the reporting date.
Changes in fulfilment cash flows
At the end of each reporting period, the Group updates the fulfilment cash flows for both LIC and LRC 
to reflect the current estimates of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows, as well as 
discount rates and other financial variables. 
The Group has an accounting policy choice which calculates changes in fulfilment cash flows at the 
end of a reporting period for changes in non-financial assumptions, changes in discount rates and 
financial assumptions. The Group first calculates the changes in discount rates and financial 
assumptions on the fulfilment cash flows (as expected at the beginning of the period) and then 
calculate changes on those cash flows from the change in non-financial assumptions.
Experience adjustments are the difference between:
○ The expected cash flow estimate at the beginning of the period and the actual cash flows for 
premiums received in
○ the period (and any related cash flows paid such as insurance acquisition cash flows)
○ The expected cash flow estimate at the beginning of the period and the actual incurred amounts of 
insurance service expenses in the period (excluding insurance acquisition expenses)
Experience adjustments relating to current or past service are recognised in profit or loss. For 
incurred claims (including incurred but not reported) and other incurred insurance service expenses, 
experience adjustments always relate to current or past service. They are included in profit or loss as 
part of insurance service expenses.
Experience adjustments relating to future service are included in the LRC by adjusting the CSM. The 
release of the CSM depends on whether the contract does not participate, participates indirectly, or 
directly participates in the performance of the specified underlying items. At the end of each reporting 
period, the Group re-estimates the LRC fulfilment cash flows, updating for changes in assumptions 
relating to financial and non-financial risks.
Adjustments to the CSM
For insurance contracts without direct participating features, the following changes in fulfilment cash 
flows are considered to be related to future service and adjust (or ‘unlock’) the CSM of the group of

143
insurance contracts:
○ Experience adjustments relating to the premiums received in the period that relate to future service, 
and any related cash flows such as insurance acquisition cash flows and premium-based taxes 
measured at the ‘locked in’ discount rates applicable when the contracts in the group were initially 
recognized;
○ The change in the estimate of the present value of expected future cash flows in the liability for 
remaining coverage, related to non-financial variables, measured at the ‘locked in’ discount rates 
applicable when the contracts in the group were initially recognised. All financial variables are 
locked in at initial recognition;
○ Changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to future service. The Group has 
elected not to disaggregate the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk between 
(i) a change related to non-financial risk and (ii) the effect of the time value of money and changes 
in the time value of money;
○ Differences between the amount of investment components that were expected to be payable in the 
period and the amount of investment components that actually became payable. The amount of 
investment components expected to be payable in the period is measured at the discount rates 
applicable before it became payable.
The following adjustments do not relate to future service and thus do not adjust the CSM:
○ Changes in fulfilment cash flows for the effect of the time value of money and the effect of financial 
risk and changes thereof;
○ Changes in the fulfilment cash flows relating to the LIC;
○ Experience adjustments relating to insurance service expenses (excluding insurance acquisition 
cash flows).
Any further increases in fulfilment cash flows relating to future coverage are recognised in profit or 
loss as they occur, increasing the loss component of the group of insurance contracts. Any 
subsequent decreases in fulfilment cash flows related to future coverage do not adjust the CSM until 
the loss component of the group is fully reversed through profit or loss.
At the end of the reporting period, the carrying amount of the CSM for a group of insurance contracts 
without direct participating features is the carrying amount at the beginning of the period adjusted for:
○ The effect of any new contracts added to the group;
○ Interest accreted on the carrying amount of the CSM measured at the discount rates determined at 
initial recognition;
○ The changes in fulfilment cash flows related to future service, except:
 ◦ Increases in fulfilment cash flows that exceed the carrying amount of the CSM, giving rise to a 
lossthat results in the group of contracts becoming onerous or more onerous
 ◦ Decreases in fulfilment cash flows that reverse a previously recognised loss on a group of 
onerouscontracts
○ The effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM;
○ The amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the transfer of insurance contract 
services in the period, determined by the allocation of the CSM remaining at the end of the reporting 
period over the current and remaining coverage period.
Recognition of the CSM in profit or loss
An amount of the CSM is released to profit or loss in each period during which the insurance contract 
services are provided.
In determining the amount of the CSM to be released in each period, the Group follows three steps:
○ Determine the total number of coverage units in the group. The amount of coverage units in the 
group is determined by considering the quantity of benefits provided under the contract and the 
expected coverage period for each contract;
○ Allocate the CSM at the end of the period (before any of it is released to profit or loss to reflect the 
insurance contract services provided in the period) equally to each of the coverage units provided 
in the current period and expected to be provided in the future;
○ Recognise in profit or loss the amount of CSM allocated to the coverage units provided during the 
period.
The number of coverage units change as insurance contract services are provided, contracts expire, 
lapse or surrender and new contracts are added to the group. The total number of coverage units 
depends on the expected duration of the obligations that the Group has from its contracts. These can 
differ from the legal contract maturity because of the impact of policyholder behaviour and the 
uncertainty surrounding future insured events. By determining a number of coverage units, the Group 
exercises judgement in estimating the likelihood of insured events occurring and policyholder 
behaviour to the extent that they affect expected period of coverage in the group, the different levels 
of service offered across periods (e.g. policyholder exercising an option and adding an additional 
coverage for a previously guaranteed price) and the ‘quantity of benefits’ provided under a contract.

Contracts with cash flows not dependent on underlying items
In determining the number of coverage units, the Group applies the following methods:
For term life (with level or decreasing sum assured) and fixed annuity policies, a method based on the 
expected coverage period and maximum contractual cover in each period is applied. This method is 
appropriate as there is variability in the contractual cover in each period and, therefore, variability in 
the amount of the service provided in each period.
The amount of CSM allocated to each coverage unit changes over time, as the amount of CSM 
changes. The allocation of the CSM to coverage units is done at the end of the period, after reflecting 
all other CSM adjustments (the accretion of interest and the effect of change in assumptions relating 
to future coverage), but before any of it is released to profit or loss. The amount of CSM remaining at 
the end of the reporting period is allocated equally to the coverage units provided in the period and 
the remaining coverage units relating to future periods.
H.3 Insurance contracts measured under the premium allocation approach
The Group applies the PAA to the measurement of motor and property insurance contracts with a 
coverage period of each contract in the group of one year or less. The Group applies the PAA to the 
measurement of motor and property insurance contracts with a coverage period of each contract in 
the group of more than one year if PAA model is applied.
On initial recognition, the Group measures the LRC at the amount of premiums received in cash. As all 
issued insurance contracts to which the PAA is applied have coverage of a year or less, the Group 
applies a policy of amortising all insurance acquisition cash flows over the contract’s coverage period.
Premiums due to the Group for insurance contract services already provided in the period but not yet 
received at the end of the reporting period are included in the LRC. The carrying amount of the LRC at 
the end of each subsequent reporting period represents the carrying amount at the start of the 
reporting period adjusted for the premiums received in the period and the amount recognised as 
insurance revenue for insurance contract services provided in that period.
The Group has determined that there is no significant financing component in motor and property 
insurance contracts with a coverage period of one year or less. The Group does not discount the 
liability for remaining coverage to reflect the time value of money and financial risk for such insurance 
contracts.
The Group also applies the PAA to the all-quota share property and motor reinsurance contracts held. 
The coverage period of such reinsurance contracts held is 15 months or less. As the coverage period 
exceeds one year, the Group at initial recognition assesses whether the PAA is a reasonable 
approximation of the General Model.
For motor and property reinsurance contracts held with a coverage period longer than one year, the 
Group exercises judgement to determine whether a significant financing component exists. For 
groups of reinsurance contracts held with a significant financing component, the Group adjusts the 
LRC for the time value of money using discount rates determined at initial recognition.
For both motor and property insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held, the carrying 
amount of the LIC is measured applying the General Model, except that:
○ For claims that the Group expects to be paid within one year or less from the date of incurrence, the 
Group does not adjust future cash flows for the time value of money and the effects of financial risks;
○ For claims expected to take more than one year to settle are discounted applying the discount rate 
at the time the incurred claim is initially recognized.
Applying the PAA, the insurance revenue is measured at the amount allocated from the expected 
premium receipts excluding any investment component. The allocation is done on the basis of the 
passage of time. The Group applies judgement in determining the basis of allocation. When facts and 
circumstances indicate that a group of contracts has become onerous, the Group performs a test for 
onerousness. If the amount of the fulfilment cash flows exceeds the carrying amount of the LRC, the 
Group recognises the amount of the difference as a loss in profit or loss and increases the LRC for the 
corresponding amount.
H.4 Onerous contracts
The Group considers an insurance contract to be onerous if the expected fulfilment cash flows 
allocated to the contract, any previously recognised acquisition cash flows and any cash flows arising 
from the contract at the date of initial recognition in total result in a net cash outflow.
On initial recognition, the onerous assessment is done on an individual contract level assessing on a 
best estimate of future expected cashflows including a risk adjustment for non-financial risk. 
Contracts expected on initial recognition to be loss-making are grouped together and such groups are 
measured and presented separately. Once contracts are allocated to a group, they are not re-
allocated to another group, unless they are substantively modified.
On initial recognition, the CSM of the group of onerous contracts is nil and the group’s measurement 
consists entirely of fulfilment cash flows. A net outflow expected from a group of contracts 
determined to be onerous is considered to be the group’s ‘loss component’. It is initially calculated

when the group is first considered to be onerous and is recognised at that date in profit or loss. The 
amount of the group’s loss component is tracked for the purposes of presentation and subsequent 
measurement.
After the loss component is recognised, the Group allocates any subsequent changes in fulfilment 
cash flows of the LRC on a systematic basis between the loss component and the LRC excluding the 
loss component. 
For groups of onerous contracts, without direct participating features, the Group uses locked-in 
discount rates. They are determined at initial recognition to calculate the changes in the estimate of 
future cash flows relating to future service (both changes in a loss component and reversals of a loss 
component).
For all issued contracts, other than those accounted for applying the PAA, the subsequent changes in 
the fulfilment cash flows of the LRC to be allocated are:
○ Insurance finance income or expense;
○ Changes in risk adjustment for non-financial risk recognised in profit or loss representing release 
from risk in the period;
○ Estimates of the present value of future cash flows for claims and expenses released from the LRC 
because of incurred insurance service expenses in the period.
The Group determines the systematic allocation of insurance service expenses incurred based on the 
percentage of loss component to the total fulfilment cash outflows included in the LRC.
Any subsequent decreases in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service allocated to the group 
(arising from changes in estimates of future cash flows and the risk adjustments for non-financial risk) 
are allocated first to the loss component only. Once it is exhausted, any further decreases in fulfilment 
cash flows relating to future service results in the establishment of the group’s CSM.
For onerous groups of contracts, revenue is calculated as the amount of insurance service expenses 
expected at the beginning of the period that form part of revenue and reflects only:
○ The change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk due to expected release from risk in the 
period (excluding the amount systematically allocated to the loss component);
○ The estimates of the present value of future cash flows related to claims expected to incur in the 
period (excluding the systematic allocation to the loss component);
○ The allocation, based on the coverage units, of the portion of premiums that relates to the recovery 
of the insurance acquisition cash flows.
All these amounts are accounted for as a reduction of the LRC excluding the loss component.
The Group recognises amounts in insurance service expenses related to the loss component arising 
from:
○ Changes in fulfilment cash flows arising from changes in estimates related to future service that 
establish or further increase the loss component;
○ Subsequent decreases in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service and reduce the loss 
component until it is exhausted;
○ Systematic allocation to the loss component arising both from changes in the risk adjustment for 
non-financial risk and from incurred insurance services expenses.
I. Modification and derecognition
The Group derecognises the original contract and recognises the modified contract as a new 
contract, if the terms of insurance contracts are modified and the following conditions are met:
○ If the modified terms were included at contract inception and the Group would have concluded that 
the modified contract:
 ◦ Is outside of the scope of IFRS 17;
 ◦ Results in a different insurance contract due to separating components from the host contract;
 ◦ Results in a substantially different contract boundary;
 ◦ Would be included in a different group of contracts.
○ The original contract was accounted for applying the PAA, but the modified contract no longer 
meets the PAA eligibility criteria for that approach.
If the contract modification meets any of the conditions, the Group performs all assessments 
applicable at initial recognition, derecognises the original contract and recognises the new modified 
contract as if it was entered for the first time.
If the contract modification does not meet any of the conditions, the Group treats the effect of the 
modification as changes in the estimates of fulfilment cash flows.
For insurance contracts accounted for applying the General Model, a change in the estimates of 
fulfilment cash flows results in a revised end of period CSM (before the current period allocation). A 
portion of the revised end of period CSM is allocated to the current period, as is the revised CSM

amount applied from the beginning of the period but reflecting the change in the coverage units due 
to the modification during the period. This portion is calculated using updated coverage unit amounts 
determined at the end of the period and weighted to reflect the fact that the revised coverage existed 
for only part of the current period.
For insurance contracts accounted for applying the PAA, the Group adjusts insurance revenue 
prospectively from the time of the contract modification.
The Group derecognises an insurance contract when, and only when the contract is:
○ Extinguished (when the obligation specified in the insurance contract expires or is discharged or 
cancelled);
○ Modified and the derecognition criteria are met.
When the Group derecognises an insurance contract from within a group of contracts, it:
○ Adjusts the fulfilment cash flows allocated to the group to eliminate the present value of the future 
cash flows and risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to the rights and obligations that have 
been derecognised from the group;
○ Adjusts the CSM of the group for the change in the fulfilment cash flows (unless it relates to the 
increase or reversal of the loss component);
○ Adjusts the number of coverage units for expected remaining insurance contract services to reflect 
the coverage units derecognised from the group, and recognises in profit or loss in the period the 
amount of CSM based on that adjusted number.
When the Group transfers an insurance contract to a third party and that results in derecognition, the 
Group adjusts the CSM of the group from which the contract has been derecognised for the difference 
between the change in the carrying amount of the group caused by the derecognised fulfilment cash 
flows and the premium charged by the third party for the transfer.
When the Group derecognises an insurance contract due to modification, it derecognises the original 
insurance contract and recognises a new one. The Group adjusts the CSM of the group from which the 
modified contract has been derecognised for the difference between the change in the carrying 
amount of the group as a result of adjustment to fulfilment cash flows due to derecognition and the 
premium the Group would have charged had it entered into a contract with equivalent terms as the 
new contract at the date of the contract modification, less any additional premium actually charged 
for the modification.
J. Presentation
The Group has presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position the carrying 
amount of portfolios of insurance contracts that are assets and those that are liabilities, and the 
portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are assets and those that are liabilities.
The Group disaggregates the amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss into 
insurance revenue and insurance service expenses. The Group has voluntarily included the net 
insurance finance income or expenses line in insurance revenue
The Group does not disaggregate the change in risk adjustment for non-financial risk between a 
financial and nonfinancial portion. It includes the entire change as part of the insurance service result.
J.1 Insurance revenue
As the Group provides insurance services under a group of insurance contracts issued, it reduces its 
LRC and recognises insurance revenue, which is measured at the amount of consideration the Group 
expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
For groups of insurance contracts measured under the General Model, insurance revenue consists of 
the sum of the changes in the LRC due to:
○ The insurance service expenses incurred in the period measured at the amounts expected at the 
beginning of the period, excluding:
 ◦ Amounts allocated to the loss component
 ◦ Repayments of investment components
 ◦ Insurance acquisition expenses
 ◦ Amounts relating to risk adjustment for non-financial risk
○ The change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, excluding:
 ◦ Changes that relate to future service that adjust the CSM
 ◦ Amounts allocated to the loss component
○ The amount of CSM for the services provided in the period.
Insurance revenue also includes the portion of premiums that relate to recovering those insurance 
acquisition cash flows included in the insurance service expenses in each period. Both amounts are 
measured in a systematic way on the basis of the passage of time.

--- Page 147 ---
147
When applying the PAA, the Group recognises insurance revenue for the period based on the passage 
of time by allocating expected premium receipts including premium experience adjustments to each 
period of service. 
J.2 Insurance service expenses
Insurance service expenses arising from a group of insurance contracts issued comprises:
○ Changes in the LIC related to claims and expenses incurred in the period excluding repayment of 
investment components;
○ Changes in the LIC related to claims and expenses incurred in prior periods (related to past service);
○ Other directly attributable insurance service expenses incurred in the period;
○ Amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows, which is recognised at the same amount in both 
insurance service expenses and insurance contract revenue;
○ Loss component of onerous groups of contracts initially recognised in the period;
○ Changes in the LRC related to future service that do not adjust the CSM, because they are changes 
in the loss components of onerous groups of contracts.
J.3 Income or expenses from reinsurance contracts held
The Group presents income or expenses from a group of reinsurance contracts held and reinsurance 
finance income or expenses in profit or loss for the period separately. Income or expenses from 
reinsurance contracts held are split into the following two amounts:
○ Amount recovered from reinsurers
○ An allocation of the premiums paid
Ceding commissions that are not contingent on claims of the underlying contracts are presented as a 
deduction in the premiums to be paid to the reinsurer which is then allocated to profit or loss.
For PAA contracts
When applying the PAA, the Group does not discount the liability for remaining coverage to reflect the 
time value of money and financial risk for motor and property insurance policies with a coverage 
period of one year or less. For those claims that the Group expects to be paid within one year or less 
from the date of incurrence, the Group does not adjust future cash flows for the time value of money 
and the effects of financial risks. However, claims expected to take more than one year to settle are 
discounted applying the discount rate at the time the incurred claim is initially recognised. 
For non-participating contracts
For non-participating contracts whose cash flows are not affected by underlying items, the Group has 
elected to present all insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss.
Exchange differences
Exchange differences arising from changes in the carrying amount of groups of insurance contracts 
issued and reinsurance contracts held are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 
The group of insurance contracts with cash flows in different foreign currencies is assessed to be 
denominated in a single currency. Accordingly, the risk adjustment for non-financial risks and the CSM 
of the group of insurance contracts are determined in the currency of the group of contracts.
At the end of each reporting period, the carrying amount of the group of insurance contracts 
denominated in a foreign currency is translated into the functional currency. 
The amounts arising from changes in exchange rates between the currency of the group of contracts 
and the functional currency are considered as exchange differences and are recognised in profit or 
loss in the period in which they arise.
K. Contracts existing at transition date
K.1 Contracts measured under the modified retrospective approach
For all life business the Group assessed historical information available and determined that all 
reasonable and supportable information necessary for applying the full retrospective approach was 
not available for groups of insurance contracts issued between 2019 to 2021 years prior to the 
transition date. For all non-life business the Group assessed historical information available and 
determined that all reasonable and supportable information necessary for applying the full 
retrospective approach was not available for groups of insurance contracts issued before 2021 year. 
The Group elected to apply the modified retrospective approach, which was intended to achieve the 
closest possible outcome to the full retrospective application maximising the use of available 
information.
The Group applied modifications in the following areas:
○ Assessments of insurance contracts or groups of insurance contracts that would have been are 
required to be made at inception or initial recognition, such as assessments of insurance contracts 
profitability and identification of discretionary cash flows for indirect participating contracts
○ Estimation of expected future cash flows, discount rates and risk adjustment for non-financial risk 
as at the date of initial recognition

○ Determination of the CSM 
○ Determination of insurance finance income or expenses
Level of aggregation
To the extent that reasonable and supportable information was not available at the date of initial 
recognition, the Group applied simplification in assumptions development taking into account 
available and supportable information as at transition date. The Group assessed the CSM on the date 
of initial recognition to determine whether contracts belong to one of three profitability groups: 
groups of onerous contracts, groups of contracts that have no significant possibility of becoming 
onerous subsequently, and groups that are neither onerous nor have no significant possibility of 
becoming onerous subsequently.
Assessments at inception or initial recognition
The Group assessed that it did not have reasonable and supportable information to perform the 
following assessments as at the date of inception or initial recognition and accordingly performed the 
assessments using the following information available at the transition date:
Expected cash flows
The Group estimated the cash flows at the date of initial recognition by estimating these cash flows at 
the date of transition, or if known at an earlier date than the transition date, adjusted by actual cash 
flows that were known to have occurred between then and the date of initial recognition. These 
include cash flows from contracts that have ceased to exist by the date of transition.
The Group applied the simplified assumption that the expectations as at the date of transition were 
also valid at the date of initial recognition, so that only the known cash flows that have occurred since 
initial recognition are adjusted for.
Discount rates
To the extent that the Group did not have reasonable and supportable information to determine 
discount rates applicable on the date of initial recognition of the group of contracts, the Group 
estimated the discount rates using an observable yield curve that for at least three years prior to the 
transition (i.e. 2019-2021) approximated the current yield curve used for subsequent measurement 
applying IFRS 17. Since observable yield curve did not exist till 2019, the Group applied the discount 
rates as at 31 December 2019 for the valuation dates until 31 December 2019.
K.2 Contracts measured applying the fair value approach
The Group concluded that reasonable and supportable information for application of the modified 
retrospective approach was not available for Pension annuity and Obligatory Employer’s Liability Lob 
issued before 2019 and therefore applied the fair value approach for those contracts.
The Group uses reasonable and supportable information available at the transition date to:
○ Identify groups of insurance contracts
○ Determine whether an insurance contract meets the definition of an insurance contract with direct 
participation features
○ Identify discretionary cash flows for insurance contracts without direct participation features
○ Determine whether an investment contract meets the definition of an investment contract with 
discretionary participation features within the scope of IFRS 17
Level of aggregation
The Group included contracts into one group of contracts as there was no reasonable and 
supportable information available to make the division.
Measurement at the transition date
In applying the fair value approach at the transition date, the CSM or loss component of the LRC was 
estimated as the difference between the fair value and the fulfilment cash flows of the group of 
contracts as of that date. In determining fair value, the Group followed the requirements of IFRS 13 Fair 
Value Measurement, except for that standard’s requirement in relation to demand features (that fair 
value cannot be less than the amount repayable on demand), This is because it would contradict the 
IFRS 17 requirement to incorporate cash flows on a probability-weighted basis.
Discount rates
The Group used discount rates as at the date of initial recognition.
Insurance acquisition cash flows
The Group did not include an amount for insurance acquisition cash flows in the measurement of the 
groups of insurance contracts recognised at the transition date.

Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products 
or services (business segment), or in providing products or services within a particular economic 
environment (geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from 
those of other segments.
Financial guarantee contracts and letters of credit issued
Financial guarantee contracts and letters of credit issued by the Group are credit insurance that 
provides for specified payments to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a 
specified debtor fails to make a payment when due under the original or modified terms of a debt 
instrument. Such financial guarantee contracts and letters of credit issued are initially recognised at 
fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of (a) the amount recognised as a provision 
and (b) the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation of initial 
premium revenue received over the financial guarantee contracts or letters of credit issued.
New and amended IFRS Standards that are effective for the current year. 
The following amendments and interpretations are effective for the Group effective 1 January  2023:
○ IFRS 17 ( including the June 2020 and December 2021 Amendments to IFRS 17 "Insurance 
contracts”) 
○ Amendments to IAS 1- Classification of liabilities as current or non-current 
○ Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – "Disclosure of Accounting Policies” 
○ Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax Relating to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single 
Transaction 
○ Amendments to IAS 8 – "Definition of Accounting Estimates” 
The above standards and interpretations were reviewed by the Group’s management, but did not have 
a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group except for IFRS 17 Insurance 
Contracts.
New and revised IFRS Standards in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new 
and revised IFRS Standards that have been issued but are not yet effective:
The Group does not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group in future periods. 
4.
4a. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make 
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amount of income and expenses during the reporting year.  
Management evaluates its estimates and judgements on an ongoing basis. Management bases its 
estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different 
assumptions or conditions. The following estimates and judgments are considered important to the 
portrayal of the Group’s financial condition.  
Significant increase of credit risk
As explained in Note 3, ECL are measured as an allowance equal to 12-month ECL for Stage 1 assets, 
or lifetime ECL assets for Stage 2 or Stage 3 assets. An asset moves to Stage 2 when its credit risk has 
increased significantly since initial recognition. In assessing whether the credit risk of an asset has 
significantly increased, the Group takes into account qualitative and quantitative reasonable and 
supportable forward-looking information (refer to Note 31 for more details).

Establishing the number and relative weightings of forward-looking scenarios for each type 
of product/market and determining the forward-looking information relevant to each 
scenario
For treasury operations, the Bank calculates ECL on a financial asset based not only on the current 
estimates of the credit quality of the counterparty/issuer at the reporting date, but also taking into 
account possible deterioration of the financial condition due to the adverse macroeconomic factors of 
the counterparty’s/issuer’s environment in the future. In particular, the level of ECL for treasury 
operations is affected by the rating outlook (positive, stable, negative) assigned by international rating 
agencies, which affects the probability of default.
For bank loans, the calculation of ECL takes into account the possible estimated effects of changes in 
macroeconomic parameters on forecasted cash flows, migration of collective loans and collateral 
coverage.
When measuring ECL the Group uses reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, 
which is based on assumptions for the future movement of different economic drivers and how these 
drivers will affect each other. Refer to Note 31 for more details.
The key inputs used for measuring ECL are:
○ Probability of default (“PD”);
○ Loss given default (“LGD”); and
○ Exposure at default (“EAD”).
Probability of default
PD constitutes a key input in measuring ECL. PD is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given 
time horizon, the calculation of which includes historical data, assumptions and expectations of future 
conditions. 
PD for treasury operations is determined according to the Default Study from international rating 
agencies (S&P, Fitch, Moody's), which publish tabular data with the values of the probabilities of 
default. The probabilities of default are maintained up to date and are updated on a periodic basis as 
the default statistics are updated.
PD for individually assessed loans of corporate, small and medium businesses is estimated using an 
internal rating model based on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the borrower. The 
calculation of PD on loans assessed on a collective basis is carried out on the basis of historical data 
using the migration matrices and roll-rates.
Loss Given Default 
LGD is an estimate of the loss arising on default. It is based on the difference between the contractual 
cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, taking into account cash flows from 
collateral and integral credit enhancements. 
LGD for treasury operations is determined according to the Default Study data from international 
rating agencies (S&P, Fitch and Moody’s) and depends on the type of debt on the financial asset: 
senior secured/unsecured, subordinated and sovereign. In addition, LGD may be adjusted if collateral 
is provided for the asset, as well as if there are indications of impairment for the financial asset (Stage 
2 or Stage 3).
LGD for collectively assessed loans is calculated based on an estimate of the recoverability of debt in 
case of the pledged collateral sale with a discount period that corresponds to the pledged collateral 
implementation terms.
Exposure at Default 
EAD is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in 
the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, and expected 
drawdowns on committed facilities. The Group’s modelling approach for EAD reflects expected 
changes in the balance outstanding over the lifetime of the loan exposure that are permitted by the 
current contractual terms, such as amortization profiles, early repayment or overpayment, changes in 
utilization of undrawn commitments and credit mitigation actions taken before default. The Group 
uses EAD models that reflect the characteristics of the portfolios.
Models and assumptions used
The Group uses various models and assumptions in measuring fair value of financial assets as well as 
in estimating ECL. Judgement is applied in identifying the most appropriate model for each type of 
asset, as well as for determining the assumptions used in these models, including assumptions that 
relate to key drivers of credit risk. See Notes 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 31 for more details onallowances for 
ECL and Note 34 for more details on fair value measurement.
The Group makes estimates and judgments, which are constantly analyzed based on statistical data, 
actual and forecast information, as well as management experience, including expectations regarding 
future events that are reasonable in current circumstances.
In order to reflect objectively the impact of the prevailing macroeconomic conditions and in 
accordance with the recommendations of the International Accounting Standards Board, the Group

adjusted the main approaches to assessing the level of expected credit losses that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2022:
○ The Group refined the approach of calculating macroeconomic parameters in the probability of 
default rates of borrowers, as disclosed in Note 31. The impact of macroeconomic indicators is 
assessed, which more accurately reflects the changing economic conditions and an updated 
forecast of macroeconomic indicators is used based on the most relevant information.
In 2023, the allowances for ECL of financial assets in the consolidated financial statements have been 
determined on the basis of existing economic and political conditions and available forward-looking 
information. 
The carrying amount of the allowance for ECL of loans to customers as at 31 December 2023 is 
KZT 489,926 million (31 December 2022: KZT 422,388million).
Fair value measurement and valuation process
In estimating the fair value of a financial asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to 
the extent it is available. Where such Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group uses valuation models 
to determine the fair value of its financial instruments. Refer to Note 34 for more details on fair value 
measurement.
Taxation
Kazakhstan tax, currency and customs legislations are subject to varying interpretations and changes, 
which can occur frequently. Management's interpretation of such legislation as applied to the 
transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by the relevant regional and state 
authorities. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for five calendar 
years preceding the year of review. 
As at 31 December 2023, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is 
appropriate and that the Group's tax, currency and customs positions will be sustained. Significant 
additional actual taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed following any challenges by the 
relevant authorities, which could have a material impact on the Group’s reported net income. 
4b. RESTATEMENTS

As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s loan concentration to the ten largest borrowers was KZT 
1,745,993 million, which comprised 18% of the Group’s total gross loan portfolio (as at 31 December 
2022 – KZT 1,549,351 million, 19%) and 73% of the Group’s total equity (as at 31 December 2022 – 
81%). As at 31 December 2023, the allowance for expected credit losses created against these loans 
was KZT 17,489 million (as at 31 December 2022 – KZT 23,725 million).
The amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the 
counterparty. Guidelines are implemented regarding the acceptability of types of collateral and 
valuation parameters.
The main types of collateral obtained are as follows: 
○ For securities lending and reverse repurchase transactions, cash or securities;
○ For commercial lending, charges over real estate properties, equipment, guarantees of legal entities 
with external rating not lower than ‘B’;
○ For retail lending, mortgages over residential properties, motor vehicles. 
The Group obtained the following financial and non-financial assets during the year by taking 
possession of collateral held as security against loans and advances and held at the year end. The 
Group’s policy is to realise collateral on a timely basis. The primary purpose of collateral is to reduce 
the potential credit loss in case of default. Management monitors the market value of collateral 
obtained during its review of the adequacy of the allowance for expected credit losses.

Restructured and modified loans to customers
The Bank derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, if the terms of the contract are 
renegotiated in such a way that it effectively becomes a new loan, and the difference is recognized as 
a gain or loss on derecognition before an impairment loss is recognized. On initial recognition, loans 
to customers are classified in Stage 1 for the purpose of estimating expected credit losses, unless the 
loan originated is considered POCI. If the modification does not result in a significant change in cash 
flows, then derecognition does not occur. No material modification gain/(loss) of loans to customers 
was recognized in 2023 and 2022.
As at 31 December 2023, accrued interest on loans comprised KZT 213,240 million (31 December 
2022 – KZT 178,222 million).
During the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group received financial and non-financial 
assets by taking possession of collateral it held as security. As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, such 
assets of KZT 22,910 million and KZT 4,032 million, respectively, are included in assets classified as 
held for sale. 
As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, loans to customers included loans of KZT 328,102 million and
KZT 273,204 million, respectively, which terms were renegotiated. Otherwise, these loans would be 
past due.
The following is a reconciliation of the gross carrying amounts at the beginning and end of year:

During the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group has written off loans of 
KZT 43,174 million and KZT 42,746 million, respectively, which allow the writing off loans without 
being considered forgiveness of the loan for tax purpose and are therefore not subject to corporate 
income tax.
Allowance for expected credit losses and provisions
For the year ended 31 December 2023, credit loss expense on loans to customers comprised 
KZT 88,894 million (2022 year: credit loss expense on loans to customers comprised KZT 88,897 
million).  
Internal rating model for loans to customers 
Loans to customers are classified based on internal assessments and other analytical procedures. 
The respective business units classify loans according to their risk and the exposure that they 
potentially present to the Group, and this classification is verified by the risk management function. 
The Bank and its subsidiaries are using an internal rating model to classify loans in different risk 
categories. The model assists to assess the risk category based on a borrowers’ financial 
performance, credit history, quality of accounts receivable, liquidity of the borrower, market risks 
relating to the borrower, industry of the borrower and other factors. At the same time, the rating is an 
auxiliary criterion in assessing the level of increase in credit risk and staging. In addition to the rating, 
the bank takes into account such factors borrowers’ credit history and financial performance, 
changes in the value of collateral and the quality of financial guarantees.  Periodically, the required 
information is inputted into the model by credit analysts. Information input into the system and the 
estimate of the allowance for loan loss is verified by the risk management department.
The following classifications are used by the rating model:
○ Rating score 1 - superior loan rating, minimal credit risk;
○ Rating score 2 - very high quality of loan, very low credit risk;
○ Rating score 3 - high quality of loan, low credit risk;
○ Rating score 4 - satisfactory quality of loan, insignificant risk;
○ Rating score 5 - credit risk can increase at economic variation;
○ Rating score 6 - high risk at economic variation;
○ Rating score 7 - high risk of default, in the absence of other factors mentioned above, paying 
capacity of the borrower depends on favorable economic circumstances;
○ Rating score 8 - 10 - very high risk of default/default.

Pools of homogeneous loans – loans to customers are included in groups of loans with similar credit 
risk characteristics (i.e. the characteristics include sector of the economy, borrower activities, type of 
loan program, level of defaults, internal ratings and other factors). Pools of homogeneous loans 
include assets that have been assessed collectively.
An analysis of the Group’s credit risk exposure per class of financial asset, internal rating and “stage” 
without taking into account the effects of any collateral or other credit enhancements is provided in 
the following table. Unless specifically indicated, for financial assets, the amounts in the table 
represent gross carrying amounts.

As at 31 December 2023, the increase in construction in progress in amount of KZT 22,759 million is 
associated with the construction of the Bank’s administrative buildings in Astana and Tashkent, as well 
as the construction of a Data Processing Center in Astana.
The Group’s revaluation policy requires the entire asset class of buildings and construction to be 
revalued every three years. In the event of significant changes in specific market or property 
indicators, the Group may opt to perform revaluations more regularly. In 2023, the management of the 
Group has not identified such significant changes in the commercial property market for similar 
buildings that Group owns and no revaluation has been performed accordingly.
The Group had its buildings and properties revalued during 2022 by independent appraisers. The 
independent appraisers used three approaches to identify the fair value of the property and 
equipment - the income approach with the income capitalisation method, the comparative approach, 
using market information to identify the fair value of buildings and structures under active market 
conditions, and the cost approach when no active market existed for items subject to revaluation. 
As at 31 December 2023, the fair value measurements of the Group’s buildings and construction, are 
categorised into Level 2 in the amount of KZT 134,260 million, respectively (31 December 2022 KZT 
135,421 million). A description of the measurement hierarchy is disclosed in Note 36. 
As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of property and equipment that would have been 
recognised had the assets been carried under the cost model is KZT 107,033 million 
(31 December 2021: KZT 107,045 million).
15. ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE 
AND LIABILITIES DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE 
TO ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
After the default of some counterparties on loans to customers, the Group recognised the property 
pledged as collateral for those loans as assets held for sale at fair value. The assets have been 
subsequently measured at the lower of fair value less disposal costs or the carrying value, as the 
Group’s management of the appropriate level committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active 
programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan was initiated. 
Assets held for sale comprised the following:
OJSC Halyk Bank Kyrgyzstan is a commercial bank registered in Kyrgyzstan, which by type of activity 
is a universal bank. Created on 12 April 1999, in 2004 was acquired by JSC Halyk Bank of Kazakhstan. 
OJSC Halyk Bank Kyrgyzstan has 10 branches and provides a wide range of banking services. The 
share of participation of JSC Halyk Bank of Kazakhstan in the capital is 100%.
On 24 October 2023, an agreement was signed on the sale of 100% of the shares of OJSC Halyk Bank 
Kyrgyzstan. The completion of the transaction is planned after receiving the consent of the National 
Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic from the Buyer. The expected completion date for the sale of JSC Halyk

Kyrgyzstan were classified as held for sale.
The major classes of assets, net of impairment, and liabilities of OJSC Halyk Bank Kyrgyzstan as at 
31 December 2023 are as follows:

In November 2022, the Group performed an independent valuation of its assets held for sale and 
based on the results recognised an impairment loss of KZT 1,044 million, included to the “Loss from 
impairment of assets held for sale” in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. 
Despite the Group actively marketing these assets for sale, the majority have not been sold within a 
short timeframe. However, the management remains committed to the sale of these assets. As the 
assets are carried at a price not exceeding the current fair value less costs to sell, they continued to be 
classified as held for sale at the end of 2023 and 2022.
The fair value of the Group's non-current assets held for sale was determined by independent 
appraisers. Income approach, comparative approach and cost-based approach were used to 
estimate the fair value of those non-current assets. To estimate the fair value of the properties, the 
highest and best use of the properties is their current use. There has been no change to the valuation 
technique during the year.
Details of the Group's assets held for sale and information about the fair value hierarchy as at 31 
December 2023 and 2022 are as follows:

Amounts due to customers include the following:
As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s ten largest groups of related customers accounted for 
approximately 11% of the total amounts due to customers (31 December 2022 – 17%), where each

notice so as to realise its liquid assets to enable repayment.

received in accordance with the Government program (“the Program”) to finance small and medium 
enterprises (“SME”) operating in certain industries. According to the loan agreements between 
DAMU and the Group, the Group is responsible to extend loans to SME borrowers, eligible to 
participate in the Program, up to 10 years at a 5.0% interest rate.
As at 31 December 2023, the Group entered into an agreement with DAMU to provide a credit line for 
financing leasing transactions of small and medium-sized businesses in the amount of KZT 1,665 
million with maturity until 2028. Under the terms of the loan agreement, loans are issued at a rate of 
13%, provided that the Group obtains sufficient collateral. 
As at 31 December 2023, loans from JSC Development Bank of Kazakhstan (“DBK”) included long-
term loans of KZT 36,844 million (31 December 2022 – KZT 36,045 million) at a 2.0% interest rate 
maturing in 2029 – 2037, to finance corporate enterprises operating in manufacturing industries, as 
well as a long-term loan of KZT 43,796 million (31 December 2022 – KZT 43,796 million) at a 1.0% 
interest rate maturing in 2035, to finance the purchase of cars by the Group’s retail customers. 
According to the loan agreement between DBK and the Group, the Group is responsible to extend 
loans to corporate borrowers, eligible to participate in the Program, up to 10 years at a 6.0% interest 
rate, and to retail borrowers – up to 5 years at a 4.0% interest rate.
As at 31 December 2023, loans from JSC Industrial Development Fund (“IDF”) included long-term 
loans of of KZT 22,500 million at 1.0% interest rate maturing in 2052 to finance the purchase of 
domestically produced vehicles by the Group’s retail customers. According to the loan agreement 
between the IDF and the Group, the Group is responsible for providing loans to retail business 
borrowers at a rate of 4.0% with a maturity of no more than 7 years.
As at 31 December 2023, loans from JSC Agrarian Credit Corporation under the “Ken-Dala” program 
included long-term loans in the amount of KZT 2,777 million (31 December 2022 – KZT 9,668 million) 
at 1.5%-5% interest rate with a repayment period until 18 November 2025. Loans must be used for 
subsequent lending to subjects of the agro-industrial complex at 4%-5% interest rate for the final 
borrower, with a loan period until 1 November 2025. According to the loan agreements between JSC 
Agrarian Credit Corporation and the Group, loans are provided to replenish working capital for spring 
field and harvesting work.
The management of the Group believes that there are no other similar financial instruments and, due 
to their special nature, these loans from DAMU, DBK, JSC Agrarian Credit Corporation and IDF 
represent separate segments in the lending market for agricultural entities, SME and retail lending. As 
a result, the loans from DAMU, DBK, JSC Agrarian Credit Corporation and IDF were received as part of 
an orderly transaction and, as such, were recorded at fair value at the date of recognition, which was 
determined to be the cash consideration transferred to the customers.

are as follows:
Details of transferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety as at 31 December 
2023 and 2022 are disclosed below.
Loans under repurchase agreements are used by the Group to provide current cash flows in KZT 
within the Group’s operating activities. The Group regularly uses this type of instrument to attract 
short-term liquidity and plans to continue raising funds through loans under repurchase agreements 
when necessary.

The Group has determined that it retains substantially all the risks and rewards of these securities, 
which include credit risk and market risk, and therefore it has not amortized them. In addition, it 
amortizes a financial liability for cash received as collateral.
Certain of the Group’s outstanding financing agreements include covenants restricting the Group’s 
ability to create security interests over its assets. Should the Group default under these covenants, 
this could result in cross-accelerations and cross-defaults under the terms of the Group’s other 
financing arrangements.
The Group’s management believes that as at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group was in 
compliance with the covenants.

Current income tax assets and liabilities comprise:
The Group has offset deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial 
position where a right of offset existed. The amounts presented after offset comprise:
Kazakhstan and other countries where the Group operates currently have a number of laws related to 
various taxes imposed by both state and regional government authorities. Applicable taxes include 
value added tax, income tax, social taxes, and others. Implemented regulations are often unclear or 
nonexistent and few precedents have been established. Often, differing opinions regarding legal 
interpretation exist both among and within government ministries and organisations; thus, creating 
uncertainties and areas of conflict. Tax declarations, together with other legal compliance areas 
(for example, customs and currency control matters) are subject to review and investigation by a 
number of authorities, which are enabled by law to impose severe fines, penalties and interest 
charges. These facts create substantially more significant tax risks in Kazakhstan than typically found 
in countries with more developed tax systems.

Commercial legislation of the countries where the Group operates, including tax legislation, may allow 
more than one interpretation. In addition, there is a risk of tax authorities making arbitrary judgments 
of business activities. If a particular treatment, based on management’s judgment of the Group’s 
business activities, was to be challenged by the tax authorities, the Group may be assessed additional 
taxes, penalties and interest. 
Such uncertainty may relate to the valuation of financial instruments and the market pricing of deals. 
Additionally, such uncertainty may relate to the valuation of temporary differences on the provision 
and recovery of the provision for impairment losses on loans to customers and receivables, as an 
underestimation of the taxable profit. 
In Kazakhstan, tax years remain open for review by the tax authorities for five years. However, tax 
authorities may perform additional reviews, if considered necessary. In accordance with judicial 
rulings, the period of review can be altered, if the court acknowledges the fact of interdiction to 
conducting the tax review by the tax authorities.
Management believes that the Group is in compliance with the tax laws affecting its operations; 
however, the risk that relevant authorities could take differing positions with regard to interpretive 
issues remains.

22. OTHER LIABILITIES
Other liabilities include: 
The liability from continuing involvement represents obligations towards JSC Kazakhstan 
Sustainability Fund (hereinafter referred to as the “Operator”) associated with the state mortgage 
program “7-20-25” and other programs. In accordance with the terms of this program, the Bank 
provides mortgage loans to borrowers and transfers the rights of claim on the loans to the Program 
Operator. In accordance with the program and the trust management agreement, the Bank carries out 
trust management of the transferred mortgage loans. At the same time, the Bank is obliged to redeem 
the rights of claim on the transferred mortgage loans if there is a delay in the principal debt and 
interest on loans for more than 90 calendar days. The repurchase is carried out at the nominal value 
of the loan on the date of purchase.

The Bank has determined that It has no transferred or retained all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of these assets, in particular credit risk, but has retained control of the transferred assets and 
continues to recognize loans to the extent of its continuing involvement in them. The extent of the 
continuing involvement is limited to the maximum amount of consideration received that the Bank 
may be required to repay because the Banks continuing involvement takes the form of a guarantee 
over the transferred asset. Because the Bank continues to recognize an asset to the extent of its 
continuing involvement in loans to customers, the Bank also recognizes an associated liability.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income for the year attributable 
to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of participating shares outstanding 
during the year. 
According to Kazakhstan legislation on Joint Stock Companies, dividend payments on common 
shares may not exceed dividend payments on preferred shares for the same year. Therefore, net profit 
for the year is allocated to the ordinary shares and the preferred shares in accordance with their legal 
and contractual dividend rights to participate in undistributed earnings.

33. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management is fundamental to the Group’s banking business and is an essential element of the 
Group’s operations. The main risks inherent to the Group’s operations are those related to:
○ Credit risk;
○ Liquidity risk; and
○ Market risk.
The Group recognises that it is essential to have efficient and effective risk management processes in 
place. To enable this, the Group has established a risk management framework, whose main purpose 
is to protect the Group from risk and allow it to achieve its performance objectives. Through the risk 
management framework, the Group manages the following risks.
Risk appetite management
Risk appetite is the aggregate level and types of risks that the Bank is ready to accept when achieving 
strategic objectives and business plan.
In order to build an effective system for managing the Bank's risk appetite, the risk appetite strategy 
of JSC Halyk Bank was developed and approved.
The risk appetite strategy defines clear boundaries of the volume of accepted significant risks in 
which the Bank operates as part of the implementation of the overall development strategy of Halyk 
Group, and also determines the risk profile of the Bank's activities in order to prevent the 
implementation of risks or minimize their negative impact on the financial position of the Bank. 
As part of the development and implementation of the risk appetite strategy for each significant level 
of risk, the Board of Directors approved the levels of risk appetite (for credit risk, market risk, liquidity 
risk, operational risk), taking into account the adopted business model, scale of activities, types and 
complexity of the Bank's operations.

Internal process for assessing capital adequacy
In accordance with the requirements of the rules for the formation of a risk management and internal 
control system for second-tier banks, the Group developed and implemented an internal process for 
assessing capital adequacy, which was approved by the Board of Directors. The internal capital 
adequacy assessment process (the “ICAAP”) is a set of processes for managing significant risks, 
taking into account the volume of assets, the nature and level of complexity of the activity, the 
organizational structure, strategic plans, risk profile, regulatory framework, assessment and 
aggregation of such risks in order to determine target level of the Group's capital adequacy to 
maintain a stable financial position and solvency.
The purpose of the ICAAP development is to identify, assess, aggregate and control significant types 
of risks inherent in the Group's activities in order to determine the required level of capital sufficient to 
cover them, including: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. The Group assesses 
the adequacy of its equity capital, taking into account the current level of risk appetite and 
development strategy, based on the approved budget. Equity capital adequacy is assessed taking into 
account the results of stress testing of the Group's risks. The internal process for assessing capital 
adequacy is subject to continuous review of both quantitative and qualitative indicators, including the 
application of its results, approaches to stress testing, risk identification and information collection 
process, validation of risk assessment models.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss arising for the Group when a borrower/counterparty is unable to meet its 
contractual obligations on time or in full.
The risk management department plays an important role in managing and controlling the credit risk. 
This division is responsible for credit risk identification, evaluation and implementation of control and 
monitoring measures. As part of the credit risk management system, the Group maintains a sufficient 
level of allowances for expected credit losses, controls the credit risk assessment process, takes the 
necessary measures to ensure the completeness and reliability of information in order to make 
decisions, adhere to internal policies and procedures, and maintain a credit assessment procedures 
independent of the business units risks. 
The risk management department directly participates in credit decision - making processes and the 
development process of internal rules, regulations and loan programs. In addition, the department 
provides independent recommendations concerning credit exposure limitation measures, controls 
limits and monitors credit risks, the level of risk appetite for credit risk, provides relevant reporting to 
management and ensures compliance of the credit process with external laws/regulations as well as 
internal requirements and procedures. 
The Group structures the level of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk 
accepted in relation to one borrower/counterparty, or groups of borrowers, and to industry (and 
geographical) segments. Limits on the level of credit risk concentration by industry sector are 
approved and controlled by the Assets and Liabilities Management Committee (the “ALMC”). The 
Group sets the levels of risk appetite for the concentration of the loan portfolio by types of lending: 
corporate business, small and medium business, retail business to the Bank's loan portfolio, portfolio 
concentration by 10 large borrowers of the Bank, the concentration of the portfolio on foreign 
currency loans, the concentration of the loan portfolio by the acceptable rating level, PD level and NPL 
level in small and retail business in the loan portfolio by lending segment. Limits on credit risk 
exposure with respect to credit programs (SME and retail) are approved by the Management Board. 
The exposure to any one borrower, including banks and brokers, covers on and off-balance sheet 
exposures, which are reviewed by the Credit Committees and the ALMC. Actual exposures against 
limits are monitored daily.
The risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligations is restricted by the limits covering on and 
off-balance sheet exposure. 
Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of credit in the form of loans, guarantees or 
letters of credit. The credit risk for off-balance sheet financial instruments is defined as a probability 
of losses due to the inability of a counterparty to comply with the contractual terms and conditions. 
With respect to credit risk on commitments to extend credit, the Group is potentially exposed to a loss 
in an amount equal to the total unused commitments. However, the likely amount of the loss is less 
than the total unused commitments since most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon 
counterparties maintaining specific credit standards. The Group applies the same credit policy to the 
contingent liabilities as it does to the financial instruments recorded in the consolidated statement of 
financial position (i.e. the policy based on the procedures for approving the grant of loans, using limits 
to mitigate the risk, and current monitoring). The Group monitors the term to maturity of off-balance 
sheet contingencies, as longer term commitments generally have a greater degree of credit risk than 
shorter term commitments.
Structure and authorities of credit committees
Credit committees, the ALMC, the Management Board, Risk Committee and the Board of Directors are 
credit authorities responsible for the implementation of the Bank’s Credit Policy and credit decision 
making process.

Head Office Credit Committee (“СС”)
The primary goal of the CC is the implementation of the Bank’s Credit Policy in terms of credit 
operations and credit applications from corporate customers.
Branch Credit Committee and Branch Network Credit Committee (“BCC”, “BNCC”)
The primary goal of the BCC and the BNCC is the implementation of the Bank’s Credit Policy in terms 
of granting financial instruments via branches to SME customers.
Delegated credit authority limits for the BCC and the BNCC are established by the Management 
Board. The BCC makes credit decisions within its limits. If the loan application exceeds the relevant 
credit limit or the authorities of the BCC, the final decision has to be taken by the BNCC. The procedure 
of the decision-making by the BNCC involves consideration of a package of documents, including 
complex analysis and assessments of the potential borrowers conducted by the Bank’s experts.
Retail Branch Credit Committee of the Head Office (“RCCHO”) and Decision Making Center 
(“DMC”)
The primary goal of the RCCHO and the DMC, which are credit authorities, is the implementation of 
the Bank’s Credit Policy in terms of granting retail financial instruments via branches.
The DMC is comprised of credit underwriters with delegated credit authorities based on a four eyes 
principle. The DMC makes credit decisions within their authorities and limits established by the 
Management Board and the RCCHO. The RCCHO is authorised to consider loan applications that 
exceed relevant credit limits or the authorities of the DMC, as well as other matters within the 
authorities established by the Management Board.
Along with the functioning of the DMC and RCCHO, there is an automated approach for making 
decisions when lending to individuals. Automation of decision making is based on a risk-based 
approach, including Risk Based Pricing and the use of additional parameters when assessing 
customer solvency. Based on the results of consideration of applications, loan proposals are formed 
both according to the requested conditions and by offering alternative solutions for all segments of 
applicants for individuals (participants / non-participants of the salary project, pensioners, etc.). This 
approach takes into account the risk profile of the potential borrower and allows minimising the credit 
risk exposure in the decision making process.
Decision Making Center for Small Business (“DMC for SB”)
The main task of DMC is to consider loan applications in the small business sector in an amount not 
exceeding KZT 400 million.
The DMC for SB consists of credit underwriters with delegated decision-making powers based on the 
four-eye principle. The Decision Making Center takes decisions within the framework of the authority 
approved by the Board of the Bank and the limits approved by the BNCC.
Problem loans committee of the Head Office, branches
The primary goal of the problem loans committee of the Head Office, branches is the implementation 
of the Bank’s Credit Policy in terms of management, servicing and maintaining the repayment of the 
problem loans.
Authorised credit authorities of the Bank’s subsidiaries
Consideration and approval of the loan applications in the subsidiaries are performed by the 
authorised credit authorities in accordance with the internal rules and regulations of the subsidiary. 
Loan applications exceeding the established limits and authorities have to be approved by the Board 
of Directors of the subsidiaries with the preliminary consideration by the relevant credit committee, 
according to the Bank’s internal rules and regulations.

ALMC
The primary goal of the ALMC is profit maximisation and to limit the risks of banking activities related 
to raising and allocating funds and the establishment of a medium-term policy for the management of 
assets and liabilities. The main tasks of the ALMC are: liquidity management, market risk 
management, ensuring effective control over the activities of the Bank's executive bodies on financial 
risk management and determining priority areas for minimizing the Bank's risks
The ALMC is also responsible for establishing country and counterparty-bank limits. The ALMC 
reports to the Board of Directors.
The Management Board
For loan applications exceeding the authorities of the Head Office Credit Committee, the BNCC and 
the RCCHO, or exceeding the relevant limits of the BNCC and the RCCHO, have to be considered by 
the Management Board.
Risk Committee
The Committee is a collegial body under the Board of Directors and assists in the implementation of 
functions related to the formation of an effective risk management and internal control system in the 
Bank, ensuring its functioning and informing the Board of Directors about the level of risks assumed 
by the Bank.
The Board of Directors
If the loan application exceeds 5% of the Bank’s equity capital or the potential borrower is a related 
party, such applications have to be considered by the Board of Directors. 
Maximum Exposure
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk varies significantly and is dependent on both individual 
risks and general market risks.
The following table presents the maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets and contingent 
liabilities. For financial assets, the maximum exposure equals the carrying value of those assets prior 
to any offset or collateral. For financial guarantees and other contingent liabilities, the maximum 
exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the guarantee was 
called on, or in the case of commitments, if the loan amount was called on (Note 22). The collateral 
pledged is represented by the carrying amount of a financial instrument for which the collateral was 
received as security.

As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, there is no any difference between maximum exposure and net 
exposure after offset.
Significant increase in credit risk
As explained in Note 4, the Group monitors all financial assets that are subject to impairment 
requirements to assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition. If there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Group will measure the loss 
allowance based on lifetime rather than 12-month ECL.
The Group uses credit risk grades as a primary input into the determination of the term structure of the 
PD for exposures. The Group collects performance and default information about its credit risk 
exposures analyzed by jurisdiction or region and by type of product and borrower as well as by credit 
risk grading. The information used is both internal and external depending on the portfolio assessed.

The Group uses different criteria to determine whether credit risk has increased significantly per 
portfolio of assets. The criteria used are both quantitative changes in PDs as well as qualitative.  
For treasury operations (interbank transactions, securities, reverse repurchase agreements), a 
significant increase in credit risk is determined individually for each financial asset on the basis of 
quantitative indicators (rating downgrades by 3 or more steps since initial recognition, overdue by 1 
day or more since initial recognition) and qualitative indicators (negative information relating to the 
issuer/counterparty, including deterioration of financial condition, change of shareholders, the 
realization of the risk of loss of reputation, the systematic violation of prudential standards) since initial 
recognition.
For bank loans assessed on a collective basis, a significant increase in credit risk is determined on the 
basis of increase in lifetime probability of default since initial recognition over defined thresholds for 
segmented homogeneous portfolios and for loans with an overdue more than 30 days since initial 
recognition, for loans assessed on an individual basis - additionally in case of the decrease of internal 
credit rating and increase in lifetime PD on 10 percentage points in accordance with the internal rating 
model (the presence of restructuring during deterioration of the financial position for classification to 
Stage 3), expert opinions of the Bank’s specialists based on the changes in the qualitative and 
quantitative indicators of the borrower, a significant deterioration of collateral and other objective 
evidence of significant financial difficulties since initial recognition.
Stage 3 is determined for loans that are assessed on a collective basis with an overdue of over 
60 - 90 days, for loans assessed on an individual basis - over 60 days past due, restructuring related 
to the deterioration of financial condition, deterioration of the internal credit rating and expert opinion 
of the Bank’s specialists.
The Group considers that certain financial instruments with low credit risk at the reporting date have 
not experienced a significant increase in credit risk. The Group applies this policy to financial 
instruments issued to sovereign and financial institutions only. The Group considers a financial 
instrument to have low credit risk when their external credit risk rating is equivalent to definition of 
'investment grade' by international rating agencies.
The Group has monitoring procedures in place to make sure that the criteria used to identify 
significant increases in credit are effective, meaning that significant increase in credit risk is identified 
before the exposure is defaulted or when the asset becomes 30 days past due.

Incorporation of forward-looking information
The Group uses forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort in its 
assessment of significant increase of credit risk as well as in its measurement of ECL. 
The incorporation of forward-looking elements reflects the expectations of the Group and involves the 
creation of two scenarios (“base case” and “downside” scenarios), including an assessment of the 
probability for each scenario. The purpose of using multiple scenarios is to model the non-linear 
impact of assumptions about macroeconomic factors on the expected credit losses. The “base case” 
scenario enters with a probability of 75% and the “downside” scenario with a probability of 25%.
Development of forecasting was carried out by JSC Halyk Finance using internal and external 
information for creating “base case” and “downside” scenarios of future forecasting of relevant 
economic variables along with a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios. The 
external information used includes economic data and forecasts published by governmental bodies 
and monetary authorities.
The Group applies probabilities to the forecast scenarios identified. The base case scenario is the 
single most-likely outcome and consists of information used by the Group for strategic planning and 
budgeting. The Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for 
each portfolio of financial instruments and, using a statistical analysis of historical data, has estimated 
relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses.
When applying these stress factors, the results of stress testing performed at the end of 2023 show a 
slight decrease in certain financial indicators of the Group (growth in provisions for expected credit 
losses, decrease in net profit and outflow of customer accounts).
At the same time, given that, the Group has a sufficient amount of equity and liquid assets, significant 
deterioration in the financial position of the Group and violation of regulatory requirements and norms 
are not predicted.
In general, a worsening of forecasted macroeconomic variables for each scenario or an increase in the 
probability of the “downside” scenario occurring will both increase the number of loans migrating 
from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and increase the estimated allowances for expected credit losses. In contrast, 
an improvement in the outlook on forecasted macroeconomic variables or an increase in the 
probability of the “base case” scenario occurring will have a positive impact. It is not possible to 
meaningfully isolate the impact of changes in the various macroeconomic variables for a particular 
scenario due to the interrelationship between the variables as well as the interrelationship between 
the level of pessimism inherent in a particular scenario and its probability of occurring.
The table below summarizes the forecasts for the following year for the principal macroeconomic 
indicators included in economic scenarios as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 for Kazakhstan, which 
is the country where the Group operates and therefore is the country that has a material impact in 
ECLs.
Financial assets are graded according to the current credit rating they have been issued by an 
international rating agency or in accordance with the Group’s internal rating system. The highest 
possible rating is AAA. Investment grade financial assets have ratings from AAA to BBB. Financial 
assets which have ratings lower than BBB are classified as speculative grade.

The banking industry is generally exposed to credit risk through its financial assets and contingent 
liabilities. Credit risk exposure of the Group is concentrated within the Republic of Kazakhstan. The 
exposure is monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the credit limits and credit worthiness 
guidelines established by the Group’s risk management policy are not breached.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk resulting from the inability of the Group to provide funds for repayment of its 
obligations in due time. The Group’s liquidity risk arises when terms of assets on active operations and 
maturity dates of obligations do not match.  
In accordance with the requirements of the Rules for the formation of a risk management and internal 
control system for second-tier banks, the Group has developed and implemented an internal process 
for assessing liquidity adequacy (“IPALA”), which was approved by the Board of Directors. IPALA is a 
set of liquidity risk management processes in order to maintain an adequate level of liquidity and 
implement an appropriate liquidity risk management system at different time intervals depending on 
the type of activity, currency. IPALA was developed in accordance with the risk appetite strategy, 
taking into account the current market and economic situation, the risk profile and the requirements 
of the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan in terms of the formation of a risk management and 
internal control system for second-tier banks, as well as the internal needs of the Bank in determining 
the main approaches and principles of the process assessing the adequacy of liquidity. In order to 
determine the risk appetite, the Board of Directors approves the levels of risk appetite for liquidity risk, 
and also uses a quantitative internal indicator of liquidity adequacy within the IPALA, which limits the 
risks of current, short-term, medium-term and long-term liquidity. In order to identify weaknesses, the 
IPALA is subject to continuous review at least once a year, which is submitted for approval by the 
Board of Directors.
As part of the risk management system, liquidity risk is measured and controlled through the following 
tools:
○ monitoring compliance with regulatory (prudential) liquidity ratios;
○ setting and regular monitoring of internal limits and triggers for liquidity risk: risk appetite level, 
IPALA ratio, limit on GAP gaps, liability concentration limits, early warning indicators of liquidity risk;
○ analysis of contractual maturities (GAP-analysis) and cash flow forecasting, including: planned 
transactions, projected rollover of attracted customer funds (taking into account the calculation of 
the stable part of funding);
○ analysis of the concentration of funding sources (by largest depositors, by currency, by funding 
maturity, by funding source;
○ indicators of early warning about liquidity risk, allowing to monitor and control liquidity risk;
○ analysis of the volume of assets that can be used as collateral to raise liquidity;
○ development and regular testing of a contingency financing plan with a description of the process 
of eliminating liquidity shortage in emergency situations;
○ stress testing of the impact of changes in various macroeconomic and other factors and parameters 
on liquidity.
Short-term liquidity needs are managed by the Group’s treasury function collecting daily cash inflow/
outflow forecasts. Long-term liquidity management is performed by the ALMC by analysing longer 
term liquidity positions and making decisions on managing significant gaps through various available 
means.

In order to manage liquidity risk, the Group analyses and evaluates cash inflows and outflows to 
determine the potential shortage of liquid assets in the future. The Group measures and forecasts 
estimated cash flows for assets and liabilities, including off-balance sheet claims and liabilities, which 
analyzes the structure of gaps between cash flows for financial assets and financial liabilities (GAP 
analysis). In a GAP analysis, cash flows are grouped into time buckets based on the following 
principles:
○  assets and liabilities are broken down into economically homogeneous and significant items;
○  securities at fair value through profit or loss are classified in the column “Less than 1 month” 
because they are available to meet the Group's short-term liquidity needs;
○  part of long-term loans provided to customers are classified in the column “From 3 months to 
1 year”, because for them, the Group has the right to unilaterally withdraw within ten months after 
due notice issued by the Group;
○  loans to customers, amounts due from credit institutions, financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, debt securities at amortized cost, other financial assets, customer 
accounts, amounts due to credit institutions, debt securities issued, other financial liabilities 
included analysis of the liquidity position based on expected contractual maturities;
○  Assets and liabilities other than those listed above are generally classified according to the payment 
schedule and the remaining period from the reporting date to the earliest contractual payment date 
or available maturity date.
For the purposes of effective control, the Group divides liquidity management into:
○ management of current (intraday)/short-term liquidity – management of assets and liabilities with a 
maturity of less than 3 months;
○ management of mid-term/long-term liquidity – management of assets and liabilities with maturity 
from 3 months to 1 year and more than 1 year.
Liquidity risk management is generally carried out by ALMC, whose main tasks are to control the 
implementation of the asset and liability management policy and the liquidity management policy, and 
to determine the need for liquid funds. The treasury department directly manages the Bank's cash 
flows and short-term liquidity within the established level of risk appetite for liquidity risk and the limits 
established by ALMC. The treasury department develops and implements measures for operational 
liquidity management. The risk management division is responsible for the implementation of the 
liquidity risk management process, for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and analyzing 
liquidity risk as part of periodic management reporting on the current state of liquidity risk with related 
analysis, and, if necessary, provides its recommendations for minimizing risks. The risk management 
division also conducts stress testing of the impact of changes in various macroeconomic and other 
factors and parameters on liquidity, including taking into account the scenario of the outflow of 
customer funds.
Liquidity risk management (identification, measurement, monitoring, control and analysis of liquidity 
risk) is carried out in accordance with the IPALA and the liquidity risk management policy, as well as 
regulatory requirements.

The change in liquidity gaps during the reporting period is associated with a change in the volume 
and/or structure of liquid assets, a change in the maturity structure of the Group's assets and 
liabilities, including due to a change in the maturity of assets (reduction/increase in the maturity of the 
portfolio of securities, loans to customers) and liabilities (reduction/increase in funds of amounts due 
to customers, amounts due to credit institutions, for debt securities issued).
As at 31 December 2023 and 2022 the Group complies with main liquidity ratios and regulatory 
liquidity requirements. 
The analysis of liabilities by maturity does not reflect the historical stability of customer current 
account balances, which have traditionally been repaid over a longer period than indicated in the 
tables above. In this regard, Management believes that although a substantial portion of current 
accounts and customer deposits are on demand and mature in less than one month, diversification of 
these deposits by number and type of depositors, and the past experience of the Group, indicate that 
these deposits provide a long-term and stable source of funding for the Group. Therefore, an essential 
part of the Group’s current accounts is considered to be stable resources for the purposes of liquidity 
analysis and management. Additionally, the accumulated gap can be sufficiently covered by 
refinancing with the repurchase agreements and sale of liquid government and other high-quality 
rated securities or attracting long-term debt funding on capital markets when necessary.
A further analysis of the liquidity risk is presented in the following tables in accordance with IFRS 7. 
The amounts disclosed in these tables do not correspond to the amounts recorded on the 
consolidated statement of financial position, as the presentation below includes a maturity analysis 
for financial liabilities and contingent liabilities based on the remaining contractual payments 
(including interest payments).

In order to manage liquidity risk, including monitoring the concentration of assets and liabilities, the 
Group sets concentration limits for certain groups of customers, both in terms of claims to customers 
and liabilities to them (by the largest depositors / borrowers, by currency baskets, by source of 
funding ); on a regular basis monitors the fulfillment of the specified limits, analyzes the dynamics of 
changes in indicators, and, if necessary, develops action plans to reduce the risk of concentration.
Additionally, on a regular basis, the Group conducts stress testing on the impact of potential changes 
in various macroeconomic and other indicators on the financial stability of the Group. One of the 
scenarios that must be considered and analyzed is a stressful outflow of customer funds (withdrawals 
from current accounts, early termination of term deposits), as well as the conversion of customer 
funds into foreign currency (from tenge to foreign currency), based on the results of a stress test, if 
necessary preventive measures are being developed to prevent a negative impact on the Group's 
operations.
The results of monitoring limits on the concentration of assets and liabilities and the results of stress 
testing are mandatory submitted for consideration by the authorized collegial bodies to get 
acquainted with the current level of the main types of risk inherent in the Group's activities and take 
corrective measures to minimize the risk, if necessary.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the Group’s earnings or equity or its ability to meet business objectives will 
be adversely affected by changes in market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, 
securities prices and other basic variables. 
The Group is exposed to market risks, which include the following components:
○ Risk of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk);
○ Risk of changes in foreign exchange rates (currency risk); 
○ Risk of changes in securities prices (price risk).
The objective of market risk management is to optimise risk/return, minimise losses in case of adverse 
events and decrease deviation of factual financial results from expected financial results.
Market risk management includes security portfolio management and control of open positions on 
currencies, interest rates and derivatives. For these purposes, the ALMC fixes limits on security 
portfolios, open positions, stop-loss limits and other limitations. Market risk limits are subject to 
review on at least an annual basis and should be monitored continuously.

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the risk of interest income 
decreases, interest expense increases or a negative impact on equity resulting from adverse changes 
in market interest rates.
The Group determines two types of interest rate risk:
○ Interest rate risk related to changes in fair values of securities portfolios, which are reflected through 
other comprehensive income;
○ Interest rate risk resulting from assets and liabilities maturity dates (dates of interest rate repricing) 
mismatch that are sensitive to interest rate changes (risk of interest rate changes).
The ALMC manages interest rate risks and market risks through the management of the Group’s 
position on interest rates to reach positive interest margins. 
The Group manages interest rates by determining the Group’s exposure to the interest rate risk using 
the approach described by the Basel Committee on the principles for the management and 
supervision of interest rate risk. This approach identifies the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk by 
testing the impact of a parallel movement in interest rates on assets and liabilities. 
Sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk
The following table presents a sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk, which has been determined 
based on “reasonably possible changes in the risk variable”. The Group assesses the reasonably 
possible changes in interest rates in tenge and foreign currencies separately, in which financial assets 
and liabilities are denominated due to the different volatility of interest rates. Particularly, a scenario of 
interest rate changes in tenge takes into account the dynamics of market interest rates (loans/
deposits, NBRK base rate etc.)
The impact on profit before tax is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the net 
interest income for one year, based on the floating rate financial assets and liabilities held 
as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 and the effect of revaluing instruments with fixed rates accounted 
for at fair value. The management of the Group believes income tax not to have a substantial effect for 
the purpose of interest rate risk management.
The impact on income before tax based on asset values as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is as 
follows:
The impact on equity is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates due to changes in retained 
earnings and the effect of revaluation of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income with fixed rates.

Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk. Currency risk arises from open positions in foreign currencies 
and adverse movements of market exchange rates that may have a negative impact on the financial 
performance of the Group.
The ALMC controls currency risk by management of the open currency position based on the 
estimations of KZT devaluation and other macroeconomic indicators, which gives the Group an 
opportunity to minimise losses from significant currency rate fluctuations of national and foreign 
currencies. 
Thetreasury department performs daily monitoring of the Group’s open currency positions, with the 
aim to comply with therequirements of the regulatory authority.
The Group is exposed to the effects of fluctuation in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates 
(primarily USD) on its financial positions, results of operations and cash flows, which are monitored 
daily. The ALMC sets limits on the level of exposure by currencies within the authority approved by the 
Board of Directors. These limits also comply with the minimum requirements of the regulator 
authority.
The Group’s principal cash flows are generated in KZT and USD. As a result, potential movements in 
the exchange rate between KZT and USD will affect the carrying value of the Group’s USD 
denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Currency risk is assessed in relation to the consolidated 
statement of financial position and off-balance sheet positions. Currently, the Group's sensitivity to 
fluctuations in exchange rates is acceptable, due to the fact that the off- balance sheet items 
significantly neutralise the consolidated statement of financial position.

Sensitivity analysis of currency risk
The table below indicates the currencies in which the Group had significant exposure at 
31 December 2023 and 2022 and its forecasted cash flows. The analysis calculates the effect of a 
reasonable possible movement of the currency rate, with all other variables held constant on the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss. A negative amount in the table reflects a potential net 
reduction in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, while a positive amount reflects a net 
potential increase. Sensitivity of currency risk is assessed based on balance sheet and off-balance 
sheet open currency positions. The management of the Group believes income tax not to have a 
substantial effect for the purpose of currency risk management.
The impact on income before tax and equity, based on asset values as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 
was calculated using the annual analysis of the exchange rate volatility based on historical data of the 
exchange rate dynamics over the last two years; see the details in the following table:

Limitations of sensitivity analysis
The above tables demonstrate the effect of a change in a key assumption, while other assumptions 
remain unchanged. In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors. It 
should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not 
be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Group’s assets and liabilities are 
actively managed. Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual 
market movement occurs. For example, the Group’s financial risk management strategy aims to 
manage the exposure to market fluctuations. As investment markets move past various trigger levels, 
management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocations 
and taking other protective actions. Consequently, the actual impact of a change in the assumptions 
may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets are held at market value on the consolidated 
statement of financial position. In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities 
and assets may lead to volatility in equity.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements 
to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Group’s view of possible near-term market 
changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty.

Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in 
market prices, where those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual security, its issuer, 
or factors affecting all securities traded in the market. The Group is exposed to price risks of its 
products, which are subject to general and specific market fluctuations.
To limit price risk, the Group determines limits for maximum losses (stop-loss) on securities from the 
trade portfolio to minimise potential losses of the trade portfolio.
Price risk assessment is also performed on the basis of the Value At Risk (“VaR”) method, through the 
establishment of Expected Shortfall (“ES”) limits on the level of expected losses, which the Bank is 
able to undertake within one day in a situation when factual losses may exceed the level of VaR.  
Calculation of VaR is based on the following parameters:
○ Reporting period – 252 working days;
○  Confidence interval – 99%;
○  The method of measurement – historical and parametric simulation.
The Group estimates the price risk at 31 December 2023 and 2022 to be not material and therefore 
quantitative information is not disclosed.
34. CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s capital management objectives, which are a broader concept than the “equity” on the 
face of the consolidated statement of financial position, are as follows:
○ To comply with the capital requirements set by NBRK;
○ To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and
○ To maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
The required level of capital is determined during the annual budgeting process, taking into account 
the above objectives, and is approved by the Management Board and the Board of Directors. As of the 
current date the capital adequacy of the Group is calculated according to prudential norms set for 
banks by the Kazakhstan regulatory authority, applying Basel Committee principles and methods. 
Currently, regulatory capital is represented by:
○ Tier 1 capital, which is required to maintain the normal operating activity of the Group and absorb 
losses as they arise. It consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital (“CET 1 capital”) and Additional Tier 
1 capital, which includes common shares issued by the Group, share premium, retained earnings, 
other accrued comprehensive income and disclosed reserves and regulatory adjustments 
(deductions); 
○ Tier 2 capital, which is required to absorb losses in case of the Group’s liquidation. This part of 
capital consists of instruments issued by the Group and deductions. 
Risk-weighted assets are split into five different groups, based on the risk level of the investment and 
its possible impairment, and weighted according to the nature of and reflecting an estimate of credit, 
market and other risks associated with each asset and counterparty, taking into account any eligible 
collateral or guarantees. A similar treatment is adopted for off-balance sheet exposure, with some 
adjustments made to reflect the more contingent nature of the potential losses.

36. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL 
INSTRUMENTS
IFRS defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market participants at a measurement date.
The fair values of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis.  
Some of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of 
each reporting year. The following table gives information about how the fair values of these financial 
assets and financial liabilities are determined (in particular, the valuation technique(s) and inputs 
used).
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to 
initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value 
is observable.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input 
that is significant to the fair value measurements. Management’s assessment of the significance of a 
particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the 
assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
The Group considers that the accounting estimate related to the valuation of financial instruments 
where quoted markets prices are not available is a key source of estimation uncertainty because: (i) it 
is highly susceptible to changes from year to year, as it requires management to make assumptions 
about interest rates, volatility, exchange rates, the credit rating of the counterparty, valuation 
adjustments and specific features of transactions and (ii) the impact that recognising a change in the 
valuations would have on the assets reported on the consolidated statement of financial position, as 
well as, the related profit or loss reported on the consolidated statement of profit or loss, could be 
material.

There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2, nor between Levels 2 and 3, during the years ended 
31 December 2023 and 2022. 
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis (but fair value disclosures are required)
The following methods and assumptions are used by the Group to estimate the fair value of financial 
instruments not carried at fair value.
Amounts due to and from credit institutions 
For assets and liabilities maturing within one month, the carrying amount approximates fair value due 
to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments. For the assets and liabilities 
maturing in over one month, the fair value was estimated as the present value of the estimated future 
cash flows, discounted at the appropriate year-end market rates.
Loans to customers 
The estimate was made by discounting the scheduled future cash flows of the individual loans 
through the estimated maturity using prevailing market rates as at the respective year-end.
Non-derivative financial assets at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income – unquoted equity securities

31 December 2023 53 132,682
Amounts due to customers 
Interest rates charged to customers closely approximate market interest rates and accordingly, the 
carrying amounts approximate fair values.
Debt securities issued 
Market values have been used to determine the fair value of debt securities traded on an active 
market. For other debt securities, the fair value was estimated as the present value of estimated future 
cash flows, discounted at the year-end market rates.
The following table sets out the carrying amount and fair values of financial assets and liabilities not 
carried at their fair values:

37. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Related parties or transactions with related parties are assessed in accordance with IAS 24 “Related 
Party Disclosures”. Related parties may enter into transactions which unrelated parties might not. 
Terms, conditions and amounts of related party transactions are usually same as those between 
unrelated parties. Transactions with related parties are settled on an arm’s-length basis and 
recognised in the financial statements according to the same accounting policy as for similar 
transactions with unrelated parties.
During 2023 and 2022, the Group entered into arm-length transactions with entities where the 
Group’s shareholders were one of the participants. Management believes that any control of these 
entities is with unrelated parties as per IFRS through the level of holding control or trust management 
arrangements, which are in compliance with Kazakhstan legislation. As such, these transactions are 
not disclosed as being with related parties.
Considering each possible related party not only their legal status is taken into account but also the 
substance of the relationship between these parties. The Group had the following balances 
outstanding as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 with related parties:
31 December 2023 31 December 2022
