Key Strategic Directions
The year 2024 marked the final stage of the previous 
strategic cycle, during which Halyk Bank focused 
on digital transformation, enhancing customer 
experience and ecosystem development, sustainable 
financing, and strengthening its position in the 
international market. These strategic priorities enabled 
the Bank to maintain its market leadership and laid 
a solid foundation for the launch of the new Halyk 
Group Development Strategy for 2025–2027.
 
a s of the end of 2024, the bank`s retail customer 
base totaled 11.3 million individuals , along with over 
300,000 SMe clients and 2,900 active corporate 
clients, making it a strategic partner for both the 
population and the business and one of the key 
providers of financial and non-financial services. 
The year 2024 marked another important 
stage of quality growth for Halyk Bank, further 
strengthening our contribution to Kazakhstan’s 
sustainable development. In a rapidly changing 
world, where climate challenges, social 
expectations and regulatory demands are 
intensifying, our Bank remains strategically 
committed to creating long-term value for all 
stakeholders.
We firmly believe that business success 
is impossible without social responsibility. That 
is why we view sustainability not as a trend, but 
as a fundamental principle that underpins our entire 
strategy. We are determined to contribute to both 
national and global Sustainable Development Goals 
by actively participating in economic progress, 
supporting the population, and implementing 
environmentally responsible solutions.

We actively developed digital products: in 2024, 91% 
of retail and 94% of SME loans were issued digitally. 
New features were launched in the Halyk Super App 
for retail clients, and the Onlinebank platform for 
legal entities was upgraded. All these steps make our 
services more accessible and convenient, particularly 
for clients in the regions.
 
Sustainability Framework and ESG Governance
In 2024, we continued to strengthen our sustainability 
governance framework. The Board of Directors 
approved a new ESG strategy for 2025–2027, aimed 
at integrating ESG factors into business processes and 
decision-making at all levels of governance.
The Bank currently operates a multi-level ESG 
governance system that includes strategic planning, 
operational control, reporting, and stakeholder 
engagement.
We pay special attention to corporate governance. We 
continue to improve our system based on international 
best practices, ensuring transparency, accountability, 
and respect for the rights of all stakeholders. 
In 2024, an assessment of the performance of the 
Bank’s Board members was conducted. The Internal 
Audit Service provided advisory support and 
developed an action plan to enhance internal control, 
risk management, and corporate governance systems.
sized businesses, covering over 80% of borrowers, 
assessing climate, social and governance risks across 
various industries.
The first stage of our ESG risk digitalisation project 
was completed, including the digitalisation of two ESG 
risk assessment tools: the Exclusion List and self-
declaration. The next step will be the digitalisation 
of borrower ESG scoring, including ESG scoring 
of investment projects.
Additionally, we began preparing for climate stress 
testing to assess the impact of physical and transition 
climate risks on our business resilience.
 
International Recognition and ESG Rating
In 2024, Halyk Bank received several national and 
international awards, including Euromoney’s “Best 
Bank in Kazakhstan” and a KASE award for leadership 
in ESG reporting and green finance.
 
f urthermore, our eSG Risk Rating 
by Sustainalytics — was 26.9 (medium risk level).
the e SG rating of Halyk bank was also upgraded 
by MSCi eSG Research from “bb” to “bbb .”
Breakthroughs in Sustainable Finance
One of the key achievements of 2024 was the 
Bank’s inaugural issue of green bonds in the amount 
of KZT 20 billion. The proceeds are directed towards 
financing projects that reduce carbon emissions, 
improve energy efficiency, and help mitigate climate 
change.
In addition to the bond issue, we adopted a Green 
Finance Policy, which formalises our approach 
to financing environmentally beneficial projects 
and sets transparent criteria and procedures 
for selection, monitoring, and reporting. Project 
selection is based on the national taxonomy of green 
projects of the Republic of Kazakhstan, international 
classifications, and the Green Bond Principles 
(GBP) developed by the International Capital Market 
Association (ICMA).
We also obtained an independent Second Party 
Opinion (SPO) on our Green Finance Policy, which 
confirmed its alignment with the key recommendations 
of the Green Bond Principles.
 
Climate Agenda and Risk Assessment
We are integrating ESG risk management into the 
Bank’s overall risk management system. In 2024, 
we carried out ESG scoring of corporate and mid-
Looking Ahead
We are confident that sustainability is the 
pathway to long-term success. In 2025, we will 
continue implementing our ESG strategy, actively 
engaging in the climate agenda, expanding 
sustainable financing, and strengthening the trust 
of all stakeholders. We thank our employees, clients, 
shareholders and partners for their contribution to our 
shared mission and firmly believe that only together 
can we build a sustainable and inclusive future for 
Kazakhstan.

offers access to more than 100 services. With 
7.9 million monthly active users, it plays a vital role 
in our digital customer engagement.
We continue large-scale modernisation of the 
country’s largest physical infrastructure: 542 branches 
and a widespread ATM network reach up to 70% of the 
rural population, ensuring access to financial services 
even in the most remote regions. We are expanding 
24/7 zones in branches, enabling clients to use 
services at any time. We are also adapting branches 
to accommodate people with disabilities — by the end 
of 2024, 92% of client premises were fully or partially 
adapted for accessibility.
The Bank is committed to socially significant 
projects that aim to expand economic opportunities 
for all. A flagship initiative is our women’s 
entrepreneurship financing programme. In 2024, 
an additional KZT 1 billion was allocated, supporting 
26 entrepreneurs. Since the programme’s launch 
in 2018, total financing has reached KZT 7 billion — 
a contribution not only to gender equality but also 
to the sustainable growth of regional economies.
We are steadily advancing along the path of ESG 
transformation, consistently integrating sustainability 
principles into strategic and operational planning, 
risk management, HR policy, and our product 
offering. We aim to build a business model that 
simultaneously creates economic value, delivers social 
benefits, and minimises environmental impact.
In line with our approved ESG strategy, we have 
identified six key focus areas for sustainable 
development: responsible financing, environmental 
responsibility, community engagement, human capital 
development, enhancement of corporate governance, 
and improved accessibility of financial services.
 
Financial Inclusion through Ecosystem and Digital 
Solutions
The Bank’s digital ecosystem continues to expand, 
providing access to financial and non-financial 
solutions for all user categories across the country, and 
promoting greater financial inclusion. The Halyk Super

Support for small and medium-sized businesses is a core 
part of the Bank’s strategy and a key contribution 
to a socially important economic sector. As of the

Over the year, 80,900 loans were issued. The SME 
loan portfolio grew by 18.3%, reaching KZT 1.9 trillion.

for legal entities.
 Halyk Bank launched the B2B platform Online-
Duken — a modern product within our ecosystem that 
connects major distributors in Kazakhstan with local 
corner stores. The platform supports the full cycle from 
ordering to delivery of goods, creating a convenient 
digital environment for efficient interaction among market 
participants.
The Bank continued to actively develop digital lending 
solutions for individual entrepreneurs. One of the key 
achievements was the introduction of the Bank’s first 
BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) product specifically designed 
for entrepreneurs.

its subsidiaries.
In 2024, Tenge Bank launched digital lending for 
individual entrepreneurs in Uzbekistan.

to Halyk Bank’s identity. We support dozens of initiatives 
in healthcare, culture, education, inclusion and sport. 
The Bank signed a five-year agreement to be the 
general partner of the Astana Half Marathon, continued 
to support the “People’s League” project for children 
from orphanages, and the Gymnastics Federation. 
For over a decade, Halyk has been the general partner 
of the Astana Opera, reaffirming its commitment 
to national cultural development. In 2024, the Bank 
supported flood victims, continued its project to provide 
free gas connections for vulnerable households, and 
helped low-income first-graders prepare for school.
In 2024, Halyk Bank was the general partner of the World 
Nomad Games — the largest international event in ethnic 
sports, recognised as intangible cultural heritage 
by UNESCO. The Games brought together more than 
4,000 athletes from over 100 countries.
Financial literacy is another priority of our social mission. 
In 2024, we continued the large-scale “Qaryzsyz 
qoqam” programme, which spans all regions 
of Kazakhstan and aims to improve financial awareness 
among the population. In 2024 alone, more than 
170,000 people completed training. The “Qamqorshy 
AMANAT” Public Fund, supported by the Bank, became 
a platform for enabling citizens’ economic self-
fulfilment, particularly in rural areas. We also supported 
Halyk Leasing JSC introduced a digital leasing service. 
Legal entities are now able to complete the full cycle, 
from submitting an application to signing a contract, 
in a fully remote format.
 
Investment in Human Capital
 
in 2024, we continued our systematic efforts 
to foster an inclusive and equitable corporate culture 
focused on development and engagement. our 
workforce comprises employees of various ages, 
ethnic backgrounds and social groups. Women make 
up 70% of staff, and 62% of middle management.
 
The Bank is implementing a digital recruitment 
platform to ensure transparency, impartiality and 
efficiency across all stages of hiring. The use 
of modern candidate assessment methodologies 
allows us to automate the evaluation of applicant 
profiles.
We have also enhanced our corporate learning system. 
Our upskilling programme covers basic, digital, ESG 
and soft skills. In 2024, we introduced the HiPRO 
programme to support career advancement and talent 
development — a system for assessing and guiding 
high-potential employees, helping to build a talent pool 
and enhance professional capabilities.

encouraging the development of financial journalism. 
In 2024, over 1,000 applications were submitted 
from cities including Astana, Almaty, Atyrau, Semey, 
Kyzylorda and other regions.
 
Financing Sustainable Projects
Halyk Bank actively supports the transition to a low-
carbon and sustainable economy by financing 
projects with strong social and environmental impact. 
In 2024, the Bank backed projects in renewable 
energy, sustainable transport, waste processing and 
energy-efficient technologies. We provided financing 
for a wind farm in Zhambyl region, a hydropower 
plant in Almaty region, and a combined-cycle power 
plant in Turkestan region. These projects contribute 
to regional development, job creation, renewable 
energy advancement and the country’s energy 
security.
In 2024, the Bank adopted its Green Finance Policy, 
which defines clear criteria for selecting eligible 
projects aligned with the national taxonomy of green 
initiatives and international standards. Under this 
Policy, we have already financed renewable energy 
and sustainable transport projects, including 
through proceeds from green bonds, reflecting the 
Bank’s systematic approach to supporting climate-
responsible growth.

Looking Ahead
The year 2024 brought new challenges and new 
opportunities. We strengthened our ESG practices, 
increased the transparency of internal processes, 
engaged our employees, and deepened our role 
as a responsible corporate citizen. We clearly 
understand that sustainability is not a one-time 
initiative but a long-term, dynamic transformation 
process. Looking ahead, we will focus on implementing 
our new ESG strategy, deepening climate and social 
risk management practices, and launching new social 
initiatives.
I extend my gratitude to our employees for their 
commitment to the Bank’s values, to our partners for 
their trust and collaboration, and to our clients for 
choosing Halyk as their reliable financial partner.

sector, delivering record performance across key business areas. Net profit 
amounted to KZT 921 billion, marking an increase of 32.8% compared to the 
previous year. The main growth drivers were the expansion of the loan portfolio

fee and commission income grew by 10.2%, despite adjustments to the tariff 
policy, driven by growth in the client base and increased transaction volumes.
The Bank’s total assets reached KZT 18.5 trillion at year-end, reflecting 
an increase of 19.7% since the beginning of the year. The gross loan portfolio 
grew by 23.2%, primarily due to an increase in retail loans (+33.3%) and

18.9% year-on-year.
Equity increased by 23.9% to KZT 3.07 trillion. Capital adequacy remains

the Development of Digital solutions 
is a strategic priority for hal yk bank 
anD a key Driver in enhancing financial 
access anD inclusion. Digitalisation helps 
eliminate geographic anD social barriers, 
proviDing equal access to moDern 
services for all client segments — 
incluDing those in remote areas, people 
with Disabilities, the elDerl y , anD small 
business owners.
Digital channels enable customers to access 
services at any time and from any location without 
visiting a branch — a crucial benefit in a country like 
Kazakhstan with vast distances between settlements. 
Expanding online access to financial tools also 
supports sustainable development by reducing 
pressure on transportation and paper-based 
infrastructure, lowering the carbon footprint, and 
encouraging responsible resource consumption.
The expansion of Halyk’s digital 
ecosystem also contributes to social 
resilience: clients gain access 
to public documents and services via 
GovTech, as well as digital commerce, 
investment, insurance, and other 
essential tools to support everyday 
needs. This is particularly important 
for improving the quality of life 
in remote regions and for enabling 
business development in underserved 
areas.
Overall, Halyk Bank’s digital solutions 
not only provide convenience 
and efficiency, but also serve 
as a powerful driver of social 
sustainability — reducing inequality 
in financial access and fostering 
digital and financial literacy.
Halyk Super app is a universal mobile 
application for individuals, offering access 
to over 100 financial and non-financial 
services. With 7.9 million monthly active 
users, it provides not only traditional banking 
functions (loans, deposits, transfers) but also 
lifestyle features, access to 66 government 
services, platforms for ticketing, travel, and 
e-commerce.

agencies entirely online. it is integrated with 
accounting systems (including 1C), supports

Thus, Halyk Bank not only provides its clients with 
high-quality financial services but also contributes

Supporting women’s entrepreneurship not only 
increases women’s economic activity but also has 
a positive multiplier effect on the development 
of families, communities, and regions where these

for women to conduct business is a key element 
of the Bank’s ESG strategy and reflects Halyk 
Bank’s commitment to building a fairer and more 
sustainable economy.
The Bank implements its own loan programme for women-led businesses aimed at supporting individual 
entrepreneurs and companies where women hold at least 50% of the share capital. The programme focuses

The development of small and individual 
entrepreneurship is a key factor in sustainable 
economic growth and social stability. For many 
Kazakhstanis, entrepreneurship becomes the main 
source of income, a means of self-fulfilment, and 
a way to ensure a decent standard of living. Therefore, 
expanding entrepreneurs’ access to modern 
financial and non-financial tools, digital services, and 
professional support is of high social importance.
In September 2024, Halyk Bank launched the 
online-Duken digital platform, uniting convenience 
stores and leading distributors. Online-Duken 
contributes to the digitalisation of the traditional 
retail sector and enables entrepreneurs 
to efficiently manage inventory, interact with 
suppliers, and access banking products directly 
within the ecosystem.
Halyk Bank considers supporting entrepreneurs 
as one of the priorities of its strategy. We offer 
comprehensive solutions that help businesses grow, 
efficiently manage operations, and reduce costs. Our 
support is not limited to lending but also includes 
the development of digital infrastructure, acquiring 
solutions, tax administration, and market access.
Supporting entrepreneurship is not only an economic 
contribution but also a driver of the country’s social 
development — small business growth facilitates 
job creation, strengthens regional economies, and 
supports sustainable income growth. Halyk Bank will 
continue expanding its solutions for entrepreneurs, 
developing digital ecosystems and contributing to the 
creation of an inclusive business environment.

anD society .
As part of its internal product management 
procedures, the Bank has implemented the 
Operational Risk Assessment Process (ORAP), which 
covers all stages of product and service development 
and modernisation. All relevant departments, 
including risk management units, are involved in this 
process, allowing potential adverse consequences 
to be identified and minimised in a timely manner.
The Risk Division conducts quarterly 
analyses of the quality of lending products 
for business purposes and carries out regular 
product monitoring, during which risk data are 
reviewed and mitigation measures proposed.
Post-launch, the Bank conducts ongoing monitoring 
of the quality and social impact of its active products. 
In the SME segment — which is of particular 
social importance — this is implemented through 
a programme-based approach and loan portfolio 
analysis. Key indicators monitored include the 
share of restructured loans, the NPL 90+ rate, loss 
coverage ratio, and the share of loans used for their 
intended purpose.
A corporate Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) 
system has been introduced to gather client 
feedback. As part of the CSI process, clients are 
contacted daily to assess the quality of service 
received. All client enquiries are recorded, 
analysed, and corrective measures initiated where 
necessary, including staff training and business 
process reviews. Quarterly CSI results are 
submitted to the Management Board for review.
The Bank’s ESG Policy includes a commitment 
to raising customer awareness of sustainable 
development and ESG risks. Initiatives include 
borrower training on topics such as carbon 
footprint assessment and ESG data quality.
Halyk Bank pays particular attention to professional 
staff development. Training programmes cover 
responsible service delivery, customer interaction, 
digital skills, and the fundamentals of ESG and 
sustainable development. All staff working with 
products and customers undergo regular online 
training and testing.
Thus, the Bank’s responsible approach to products 
and services is implemented through formalised 
risk assessment procedures, impact monitoring, 
employee training, ongoing customer dialogue, 
and corporate sustainability commitments.

in 2024, the bank continueD to activel y combat frauD by strengthening both 
internal anD external security systems. the anti-frauD system was integrateD  
with the bank’s key platforms, enabling the consoliD ation of channel -specific 
anti-frauD systems into a unifieD cross-channel system. 
The introduction of new approaches enhanced 
the security of customer funds. The use 
of big data techniques and AI tools significantly 
improved the system’s operational effectiveness.
As part of its cooperation with international 
payment systems such as Visa, Mastercard, and 
SWIFT , the Bank has implemented and actively 
uses tools such as VRM, FRM, and Payment 
Controls.
An important step in 2024 was the integration 
of the Bank’s system with the Anti-Fraud 
Center for the exchange of data on fraudulent 
transactions of the National Bank of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan. A service for the automatic 
blocking of fraudulent transactions and dropper 
accounts was launched. This initiative made it 
possible to unite the efforts of the entire market 
in combating fraud.An annual mandatory training 
course is conducted and updated to enhance 
employees’ knowledge of financial fraud 
detection and response methods.  
in 2024, 93.96% of the bank’s employees 
successfully completed the course and passed 
the testing.
Employee training is given particular attention: 
an annual course on financial fraud detection was 
held and made mandatory for all Bank employees 
in 2024.
To protect clients from fraud, the Bank has 
implemented security information screens 
in its mobile banking applications and conducts 
awareness campaigns through push notifications. 
Educational content is published across various 
online platforms, social media channels, and the 
Bank’s official website, which regularly features 
updates on new fraud schemes and methods 
of protection.

protective measures. In the event of incidents, 
a notification procedure is in place, ensuring that CISO 
leadership, responsible staff, IT division heads, the 
supervising Deputy Chairman of the Management 
Board, and, if needed, senior IT and business 
line management are informed promptly. This enables 
timely response to potential information security 
breaches.
Compliance with international information security 
standards (ISO/IEC 27001, PCI DSS, PCI 3DS, SWIFT 
CSP) is ensured through internal audits as well 
as authorised external QSA audits. In 2024, the Bank 
passed another external audit confirming compliance 
with the aforementioned standards. The Bank also 
achieved certification of its software development and 
support processes under CT PK ISO/IEC 27001.
All employees undergo mandatory annual training 
on information security and the protection 
of confidential and personal data, and receive regular

eSG RiSk Mana GeMent in lenDinG
the bank has implemented 
a multi-stage esg  
risk management process as part 
of its r esponsible financing 
policy, approved by the board 
of Directors in 2023. 
thus, the esg analysis in halyk 
bank’s lending process functions 
as a multi-layered screening 
system — from automatic 
exclusion based on prohibited 
activities to in-depth sectoral 
and client assessments — 
enabling effective management 
of sustainability risks within the 
portfolio.
The purpose of the policy is to reduce ESG risks for 
both the Bank and its clients through the consistent 
integration of environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors into lending processes. When issuing 
loans to clients, the Bank strives to consider all factors 
and risks related to environmental and social impacts, 
thereby promoting sustainability principles across the 
economy.
The Bank applies a four-tier assessment system, 
beginning with a basic compliance check 
of the borrower’s activities against the principles 
of sustainable finance (Exclusion List), and progressing 
to an assessment of the client’s exposure to ESG 
factors, considering mitigation measures and ESG 
adaptation initiatives (self-declaration, ESG scoring, 
and project scoring). Since the beginning of 2024, the 
ESG scoring procedure has been applied to borrowers 
across all sectors of the Bank’s loan portfolio.
The Exclusion List procedure involves screening clients to determine whether their 
activities and business practices fall under any prohibited types of activities defined 
by the Bank in its Responsible Financing Policy. This procedure is applied to all clients 
without exception and is intended to prevent financing of any activities that contradict 
sustainability principles and international norms.
If the client’s activities fall under the Exclusion List, financing is not permitted.
Responsible Financing Policy at Halyk Bank JSC
exclusion list 1
A full ESG scoring is applied to clients receiving financing above KZT 10 billion. 
The assessment procedure evaluates the borrower’s exposure to ESG risks based 
on implemented mitigation measures and adaptation initiatives. It includes ESG 
segmentation by industry and the development of the borrower’s target ESG profile. 
The outcome of the ESG scoring procedure is an ESG score, mapped to risk zones and 
a rating scale.
Client eSG scoring (Comprehensive eSG analysis)3
This tool is used as a basic ESG assessment for clients where the financing instrument 
exceeds KZT 1 billion. The client signs a self-declaration form confirming that they 
adequately manage the environmental and social risks inherent in their operations.
Based on the self-declaration, one of four risk levels is assigned: Low, Medium, High 
and Critical. If a high or critical risk is identified, further analysis of the identified issues 
is conducted, and the decision to lend is based on a review of the client’s operations.
Client self-declaration2
This scoring applies to large-scale investment projects where the loan amount exceeds 
KZT 25 billion and includes capital expenditure.
project/t ransaction Scoring4
The client’s final ESG rating is formed based on the combination of the client ESG score 
and the project ESG assessment (where applicable).

As of 1 January 2025, following ESG scoring of the corporate 
and medium-sized business loan portfolio, industries were classified 
by indicative ESG risk levels: Very high, High, Moderate, Low.
Within the framework of the current Methodology for Classifying 
Financed Activities by ESG Criteria (Scoring), an assessment of ESG 
risks was carried out for borrowers in the business portfolio. 
Thus, as of 01.01.2025: 2% of borrowers were classified as “green” 
projects, 48% of borrowers were classified as low ESG risk, 16% 
of borrowers were classified as moderate ESG risk, 34% of borrowers 
were classified as high ESG risk, and 0.1% of borrowers were classified 
as critical ESG risk.
The Bank engages with clients in the high and very high ESG 
risk categories. Specifically, based on an approved action plan, 
periodic monitoring of such projects is carried out, and during business 
breakfasts and meetings, clients are trained in Kazakh and Russian 
languages on the Bank’s approaches to sustainable development.
In 2024, as part of its ESG Risk Management Action Plan, the Bank 
initiated the digitalisation of ESG risk management processes. 
The following components were automated:
 f Client screening against the Exclusion List — for prompt 
identification of unacceptable practices;
 f ESG self-declaration questionnaire — as part of the Environmental 
and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) procedure.
 
Based on these data and industry-specific features, the client 
is assigned an appropriate ESG risk level, enabling the Bank to make 
informed financing decisions and prioritise sustainable development 
within its loan portfolio.
Debut GReen bonD iSSuanCe
in 2024, halyk bank took a major step in enhancing its contribution to sustainable 
development by completing its first-ever green bond issuance. on 3 December 2024, the bank 
successfully placed green bonds on the k azakhstan stock exchange (kase) for a total amount 
of kzt 20 billion with a three-year maturity. this milestone not only marked a significant 
achievement for the bank but also represented a landmark event for the development 
of k azakhstan’s sustainable finance market.
Despite market volatility, Halyk Bank’s debut floating-rate green bonds were 
placed among a broad base of market investors, underscoring the high level 
of trust in the Bank as a reliable and resilient issuer.
In line with the Bank’s Green Finance Policy, proceeds from the bond issuance 
are allocated to finance projects that:
 f Promote resource efficiency and reduce the consumption of natural 
resources;
 f Minimise negative environmental impact;
 f Contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation;
 f Support the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).
 
Eligible projects are identified based on the Green Project T axonomy 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan, international classifications, and the Green 
Bond Principles (GBP) developed by the International Capital Market 
Association (ICMA).
To ensure transparency and investor confidence, Halyk Bank engaged 
an independent Second Party Opinion (SPO). The assessment was 
carried out by Green Investment Group, which confirmed that the 
Bank’s internal procedures and documentation align with the GBP 
criteria established by ICMA. This attests to the high quality of the 
transaction’s structure and its adherence to international standards.
The Bank’s subsidiary, Halyk Finance JSC, acted as financial adviser 
and underwriter for the green bond issuance and placement, 
leveraging its extensive experience in investment banking and 
sustainable finance.
This green bond issuance is not only evidence of Halyk Bank’s strong 
social and environmental responsibility but also a contribution to the 
development of Kazakhstan’s domestic sustainable finance market. 
The Bank intends to further develop green financial instruments and 
expand its participation in environmental initiatives to support the 
transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.

GReen finanCe poliCie S
In 2024, Halyk Bank continued its systematic work 
to build an institutional framework for sustainable 
finance and approved its Green Finance Framework. 
The document was adopted by the Bank’s Board 
of Directors on 26 June 2024 and became a key 
internal instrument formalising the Bank’s approach 
to financing environmentally beneficial projects using 
green financial instruments.
The Policy was developed in line with:
 f The Green Bond Principles and Green Loan 
Principles issued by the ICMA and relevant 
credit market associations;
 f The Environmental Code of the Republic

and electric vehicle distribution.
Key parameters are tracked, including loan 
amounts, regions of implementation, installed 
capacity, expected CO₂ emissions reduction, 
and other environmental characteristics.
The Bank ensures that all financed projects 
comply with the categories defined in the Green 
T axonomy of the Republic of Kazakhstan and 
the criteria established by the Bank’s Green 
Finance Framework. These projects contribute 
to achieving climate and resource-related goals, 
including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 
increasing the share of renewable energy, 
and improving energy efficiency. See also the 
section “examples of Sustainable financing

in line with its sustainability principles, hal yk bank supports projects that contribute to environmental protection, improveD quality of life, anD the sustainable Development 
of the regions in which it operates. in 2024, the bank continueD to finance companies implementing initiatives with clear environmental anD/or social benefits.  
below are selecteD examples:
In response to the environmental priorities of the city of Almaty, Halyk Bank 
provided additional financing in 2024 for the purchase of 150 modern 
compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, continuing a line of support initiated 
in 2023. Previously, 150 similar buses had already been financed by the 
Bank. As a result, a total of 397 environmentally friendly Foton buses are now 
operating on city routes.
These gas-powered buses, compliant with Euro-5 / Euro-6 standards, emit 
significantly fewer pollutants than diesel models-twice less nitrogen oxides, 
ten times less carbon monoxide, and three times fewer other carbon oxides. 
The project contributes to improving air quality and enhancing the comfort 
and safety of public transport in Almaty.
In 2024, the Bank financed the purchase of a waste processing complex 
and equipment. The new pyrolysis module enables thermal decomposition 
of MSW, producing gas, liquid, and carbon residue, allowing for zero-waste 
processing of up to 12,000 tonnes per year.
The facility will serve Tengizchevroil (TCO) and its contractors, operating 
24/7 with high energy and environmental efficiency. It meets Kazakhstan’s 
environmental regulations and significantly reduces landfill volumes, 
emissions, and enables a closed-loop waste management system.
Given the growing interest in clean transport, in late 2023 the Bank 
provided a renewable financing limit for the official distributor of Zeekr 
EVs in Kazakhstan. Financing covers vehicle procurement, spare parts, 
accessories, and logistics.
The company currently offers Zeekr 001 and Model X, with plans to introduce 
Zeekr 7X. In 2025, around 645 EVs are expected to be sold. The project 
promotes sustainable mobility infrastructure and reduces transport-sector 
emissions.
As part of support for renewable energy sources the Bank provided 
KZT 3 billion in financing to settle debt for equipment supplied to a 52.8 MW 
wind power plant commissioned in 2018 in Atyrau Region that has been 
operating steadily to date. The plant generates clean electricity annually and 
contributes to decarbonisation and energy security in western Kazakhstan.

t o support the practical implementation 
of the environmental p olicy and the esg  
strategy, halyk bank developed and 
launched the green o ffice principles 
in 2022-a set of organisational, technical, 
and motivational measures aimed 
at reducing the environmental footprint, 
promoting efficient resource use, and 
fostering a culture of environmental 
responsibility in office operations.
Separate waste collection and disposal, including:
Support for the “My cup, please” initiative – employees receive 
discounts at the corporate café when using their own reusable 
containers (cups, thermoses), thereby reducing single-use plastic;
Cooperation with eco-friendly transport providers – the Bank has 
arranged for the rental and maintenance of bicycles, scooters, and 
e-scooters on its premises;
“Car-Free Day” campaign – encouraging employees 
to temporarily switch from personal vehicles to more 
sustainable modes of transport;
Environmental awareness for staff, including the development 
and distribution of training materials on environmental safety, 
as well as information boards and leaflets on energy and water 
conservation;
Organisation of corporate events aimed at employee 
engagement, such as “Clean-Up Day” – a large-scale clean-up 
initiative involving employees of the Head Office.
Paper (including archived documents and 
shredded materials);
Outdated office and household equipment;
Used batteries;
Worn-out tyres from company vehicles;
Fluorescent lamps;
Plastic waste (bottles, containers, etc.);
a s part of the implementation of the Green o ffice concept, the bank has introduced the following key initiatives:
The Green Office operates based on principles of environmental 
protection and resource efficiency, helping to reduce electricity, 
water and paper consumption, lower office maintenance costs, and 
promote employee well-being while preserving natural resources.
thus, the Green o ffice concept at Halyk bank not only helps 
reduce environmental impact but also fosters responsible 
behaviour among employees, reinforcing the bank’s 
commitment to sustainable development in practice.

paper consumption plastic cards and plastic consumption
halyk bank is committed to the sustainable management of natural resources, reducing environmental pressure, and improving the ecological 
efficiency of its operations. in line with the principles of its environmental p olicy, the bank implements resource-saving solutions and promotes 
a culture of environmentally responsible behaviour among its employees.
Paper remains one of the most environmentally 
sensitive resources in banking operations. 
Since 2021, the Bank has been consistently 
implementing measures to reduce paper-based 
document workflows. The introduction of an Electronic 
Document Management System and the transition 
to digital formats for storing and processing 
information have enabled a significant reduction 
in paper consumption. At the same time, the Bank 
organises the collection and transfer of waste paper 
for recycling across its branch network.
In 2024, the Bank’s own paper consumption totalled 
300.3
(А)  tonnes, representing a 12.3% decrease 
compared to 2023. This reduction was achieved 
through sustained digital transformation efforts and 
internal process optimisation programmes. Paper 
consumption by Halyk Bank Georgia JSC and Tenge 
Bank JSC in 2024 amounted to 18.05
(А)  tonnes 
(2023: 26.4 (А) tonnes). 
An additional source of environmental impact is the 
use of plastic, primarily in the issuance of payment 
cards. In 2024, the Bank issued 2,800.5 thousand 
payment cards — 12.7 thousand fewer than in 2023. 
This corresponds to 15.4
(А)  tonnes of plastic 
consumed, also lower than the 15.47(А)  tonnes 
recorded in 2023. In 2024, Halyk Bank Georgia JSC 
issued 6,016 payment cards, which equalled 0.03(A)  
tonnes of plastic.
The reduction in the issuance of plastic cards and the 
gradual expansion of alternatives (the development 
of digital card services and commission-free digital 
cards) enables the Bank to minimise its environmental 
impact. The share of plastic cards in the total number 
of cards issued amounted to 34%, down from 40% 
in 2023.

Efficient water use is another key priority within 
the Bank’s environmental management system. 
In 2024, the total water consumption across the Head 
Office and the regional branch network amounted 
to 250.87
(A) megalitres, representing a 3.9% decrease 
compared to 2023 (260.94(A) megalitres). 
Water consumption by Halyk Bank Georgia JSC and 
Tenge Bank JSC in 2024 totalled 12.43
(A) megalitres, 
compared to 6.6(А)  megalitres in 2023.
To promote efficient water use, water meters have 
been installed in all Bank offices, and a monitoring 
system has been introduced to track the condition 
of plumbing fixtures and water supply infrastructure. 
In addition, irrigation systems on adjacent premises 
have been automated, helping to minimise inefficient 
water loss.
Wastewater from Bank offices is not discharged into 
natural water bodies. In urban locations, it is diverted 
to municipal sewage systems, while in rural areas it 
is collected and transported by specialised service 
providers under formal contracts

In 2024, total energy and fuel resource consumption by the Bank and its branch network amounted 
to 432,369
(А)  GJ, representing a 0.26% increase compared to 2023 (431,239(A) GJ). This minor growth was 
attributed to seasonal fluctuations and changing weather conditions.
as part of its environmental p olicy and in accordance with its status 
as a registered entity in the state energy r egister, halyk bank 
consistently implements an energy-saving policy aimed at reducing 
energy consumption, improving energy efficiency, and minimising 
its impact on the climate system.
7 Given the specifics of the current environmental regulation in Kazakhstan (namely, the absence of a requirement to obtain permits 
for discharges into municipal sewage systems), the Bank does not set pollutant discharge limits. However, it continues to monitor the 
environmental safety of all water-related operations.

Despite the overall increase in consumption, the Bank 
continues to implement targeted measures aimed 
at reducing the energy intensity of its operations and 
transitioning to more sustainable technologies. Key 
initiatives implemented in 2024 include:
As part of its climate-oriented energy management, 
Halyk Bank also monitors and analyses greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions associated with energy use, 
relying on national regulations and international 
standards in this area. This approach supports the 
establishment of long-term decarbonisation targets for 
the Bank’s operational activities.
Development of infrastructure for sustainable 
transport: At the Bank’s Head Office, designated 
parking spaces for bicycles and electric 
scooters have been installed, including charging 
stations. This supports the reduction of the 
carbon footprint by encouraging employees 
to choose more sustainable modes of transport.
Transition to LED lighting: As part of the 
overhaul and refurbishment of its offices, the 
Bank is gradually replacing mercury-containing 
fluorescent lamps with LED lighting. This 
not only reduces electricity consumption 
but also minimises the risk of environmental 
contamination by heavy metals during the 
disposal of lighting equipment.

of waste, representing a 11.4% increase compared 
to 2023 (7,595.44 tonnes). o f the total:
The significant increase in the volume of municipal 
solid waste (MSW) is due to: the increase in the 
number of employees at the head office; a greater 
volume of procurement and replacement 
of office equipment; the purchase of furniture 
for the head office, which generates boxes and 
packaging materials; as well as dismantling works 
related to the reconfiguration of office spaces at the 
head office, which also produce MSW (in 2024, 
10.6% more than in 2023).
In accordance with internal standards and national 
regulatory requirements, the Bank ensures the 
transfer of all waste types to specialised licensed 
contractors for treatment and disposal:
 f Fluorescent lamps undergo demercurisation 
(removal of mercury vapours);
 f Vehicle tyres are shredded and recycled into 
playground surfaces;
 f Batteries are neutralised and processed for the 
extraction of non-ferrous metals;
 f MSW is disposed of at licensed landfills;
 f Waste paper is sent for recycling.

key Climate Risks in the region
Since 2022, the Bank has been working on the 
identification of key physical and transition risks, 
including:
 f An increase in the frequency and severity 
of extreme climate events;
as part of the integration of esg principles into its risk management 
system, halyk bank is consistently implementing and advancing 
practices for the assessment and management of climate-related risks. 
The climate of Kazakhstan is sharply continental, 
with pronounced seasonal and diurnal temperature 
variations. The absence of maritime air masses 
results in extreme climatic conditions-hot, 
prolonged summers and cold winters with 
persistently sub-zero temperatures.
Average winter temperatures (December–February) 
range from –9 °C to –12 °C, while in summer 
(June–August) they reach +22 °C to +23 °C. 
These conditions are accompanied by extended 
Meteorological data indicate a persistent trend of rising 
average annual temperatures in Kazakhstan since 
the 20th century. According to Kazhydromet JSC, 
since 1976, air temperatures in the country have been 
increasing by an average of 0.33 °C per decade, 
significantly exceeding the global average increase 
of 0.19 °C over the same period.
One of the most climate-vulnerable natural elements 
is the glacial system of Central Asia, the area and 
structure of which have changed by more than 30% 
over the past 50–60 years. These glaciers are critical 
for the region’s water resources, feeding major 
rivers that serve as the primary source of water for 
agricultural irrigation.
The retreat of glaciers is already contributing to the 
reduction in river water levels, negatively impacting 
water availability for agricultural needs. This 
is exacerbated by processes such as:
 f Soil degradation and nutrient depletion;
 f Land desertification;
 f Declining productivity of agricultural land.
 
In parallel, further glacial melting increases the risks 
of sudden floods and mudflows, the frequency and 
severity of which are expected to rise. These events 
pose threats to communities, infrastructure, and

daylight hours, abrupt weather changes, and a high 
probability of climate anomalies, including droughts, 
dust storms, sudden cold spells, and extreme

These features create the prerequisites for 
increased physical climate risks affecting both 
infrastructure and borrowers’ operations across 
various sectors. The following are the main climate-
related threats that could impact the Bank’s 
activities.
economic activities-particularly in mountainous and 
foothill regions.
According to forecasts by the Food and Agriculture 
Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), Kazakhstan 
and other Central Asian countries may face severe 
water shortages as early as 2040.
For financial institutions, including Halyk Bank, such 
developments entail risks of deteriorating financial 
performance among clients in agriculture and water-
dependent sectors, reduced collateral value, and 
heightened environmental and social tension in several 
regions.

Major floods in k azakhstan, 2000–2024
Floods and mudflows represent some of the most 
pressing climate-related risks in Kazakhstan. Between 
1985 and 2024, the country experienced seven major 
floods, making them one of the most hazardous 
types of natural disasters. Northern, central and 
western regions are particularly vulnerable, as the 
rivers in these flatland areas are predominantly fed 
by melting snow. In spring, the combination of sudden 
warming and heavy rainfall significantly increases the 
likelihood of large-scale flooding.
From an economic perspective, the most affected 
areas include:
 f The western districts of Atyrau Region, where the 
average annual damage from floods is estimated 
at around 11% of the regional GDP;
 f The southern districts of Kyzylorda Region, with 
flood-related losses amounting to approximately 
5% of the region’s GDP .
 
Moreover, around 26% of Kazakhstan’s population 
lives in mudflow-prone zones, where floods 
and mudflows may occur simultaneously. 
A total of 156 settlements are considered at risk, 
highlighting the need for systemic prevention and 
damage mitigation measures, including both adaptive 
and engineering solutions at the regional level.

The geography of flood risks in Kazakhstan reveals a high 
degree of regional vulnerability:
 f Western Kazakhstan is home to numerous rivers flowing 
into the Caspian Sea, including the Ural River, which 
passes through Atyrau. To the west of the Ural Valley lie flat 
agricultural lands with a high flood risk but relatively low 
population density.
 f Central Kazakhstan features a broad, shallow river valley 
stretching northwards towards the Tobol River. Although the 
area is sparsely populated, small settlements remain at risk 
of flooding.
 f Southern Kazakhstan is traversed by the Syr Darya 
River, which originates in the mountains of T ajikistan and 
Uzbekistan and flows through southern Kazakhstan to the 
Aral Sea. The river valley includes the city of Kyzylorda and 
several smaller towns.
 f Eastern Kazakhstan contains smaller rivers that flow into 
Lake Balkhash, creating localised flood risk zones.
 f Northeastern Kazakhstan is crossed by the region’s largest 
river, the Irtysh, which flows through the cities of Oskemen, 
Semey and Pavlodar.

t ypes of river feeding in kazakhstan
For the banking sector, this implies the need to revise territorial risk assessments, ensure adequate insurance coverage for clients, 
and account for potential losses during lending and project financing in vulnerable areas.
Climate change is exerting an increasingly noticeable 
impact on the water balance and soil conditions 
in eastern, southern, and central Kazakhstan. 
Observations from 2000 to 2013 indicate that rising 
average annual temperatures are accompanied 
by increased evaporation, reduced precipitation, and 
a resulting decrease in soil moisture in these regions.
A decline in soil moisture-an essential factor for 
agricultural productivity-poses a direct threat to crop 
yields and heightens the vulnerability of agricultural 
regions. This is especially significant for the national 
economy given the substantial role of the agri-sector 
in several provinces.
This trend may contribute to the desiccation of lake 
systems such as Lake Balkhash in the southeast 
of the country. The lake basin is home to around 20% 
of Kazakhstan’s population, and its degradation could 
trigger a cascade of ecological and socio-economic 
consequences: desertification, soil salinisation leading 
to loss of fertility, and an increase in the frequency and 
intensity of dust storms.
These processes may create a sustained water deficit, 
posing a serious threat to the resilience of agricultural 
and water-dependent businesses, as well as to the 
quality of life in affected regions.
For Halyk Bank, water-related risks signal the 
need to integrate additional climate factors into 
the creditworthiness assessment of agricultural 
clients, project risk analysis, and collateral valuation-
particularly in regions with high climate vulnerability.

Desertification is one of the most pressing environmental and socio-
economic challenges facing Kazakhstan, affecting the resilience 
of ecosystems, agricultural potential, and quality of life in rural regions. 
This process involves the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid, and 
dry sub-humid areas and is driven by both natural and human-induced 
factors-including climate change, unsustainable land use, and poor 
resource management.
As of today:
 f Out of 182 million hectares of pastureland, 14 million hectares are 
completely out of use;
 f The total area of degraded land has exceeded 50 million hectares.
 
Key natural contributors to desertification include:
 f Kazakhstan’s landlocked position and sharply continental climate;
 f Aridity and uneven distribution of water resources;
 f Widespread sandy areas (up to 30 million hectares) and saline soils 
(127 million hectares);
 f Fragile ecosystems vulnerable to disruption, due to weak soil-vegetation 
cover and disturbed soil formation cycles under drought conditions.
One of Kazakhstan’s significant regional climate risks is the decreasing level 
of the Caspian Sea, which affects environmental stability, economic activity, 
and social infrastructure in coastal areas.
According to observational data, between 1996 and 2015 the sea level 
fell by an average of 6.7 cm per year. The primary driver of this trend 
is increased evaporation due to rising average temperatures. Given the 
ongoing warming trend, a further decline in the Caspian Sea’s water level 
is almost inevitable
9.  
This shift presents risks and adverse effects for:
 f Coastal infrastructure, including energy, transport, and logistics facilities;
 f Specialised ecosystems;
 f The fishing industry and employment in coastal communities.
 
The degradation of the Caspian coastal zone also poses social and 
economic challenges, including shifts in employment patterns, reduced 
volumes of fish exports, and increased costs of adapting local settlements.
For the banking sector, the falling sea level requires a reassessment 
of long-term investment risks in coastal areas, as well as the incorporation 
of environmental constraints and climate scenarios into the evaluation 
of projects related to transport, logistics, and natural resource extraction 
in western Kazakhstan.
lanD DeGRaD ation anD De SeRtifiC ationCoa Stal Z one tHReat S: DeClininG Ca Spian Sea 
levelS
Major anthropogenic drivers of land degradation include:
 f Overgrazing and unsustainable agricultural practices;
 f Subsoil use, construction, and industrial activity;
 f Irrigation and linear infrastructure disrupting water balance;
 f Illegal logging, wildfires, uncontrolled recreational use;
 f Soil and water contamination from toxic substances and intensive 
transport activity.
 
According to the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat 
Desertification), Kazakhstan faces the following types of degradation:
 f Vegetation degradation;
 f Water and wind soil erosion;
 f Soil salinisation and humus depletion;
 f Chemical contamination of soils and groundwater;
 f Land disruption and altered hydrological regimes caused by human 
activity

impact of Climate Risks on the bank’s l oan portfolio t ransition Climate Risks 
and the bank’s Response
hal yk bank’s loan portfolio is concentrateD in strategicall y important sectors of the kazakh economy , incluDing oil anD 
gas extraction, electric power, agriculture, anD manufacturing. these sectors Demonstrate heighteneD vulnerability 
amiD increasing climate instability , particularl y Due to the growing frequency anD intensity of extreme weather events. in light of kazakhstan’s commitments to achieving 
carbon neutrality by 2060 anD its national target 
of reDucing greenhouse gas emissions by 15% from 
1990 levels by 2030, transition climate risks are 
intensifying. 
The direct impact of climate change ultimately manifests in floods, 
landslides, mudflows, forest and steppe fires, and prolonged droughts. 
These phenomena lead to crop damage, soil erosion, salinisation and 
waterlogging, and the temporary withdrawal of extensive agricultural lands 
from productive use.
Changes occur in logistics routes and the functioning of transport 
infrastructure, including seaports and river ports;
The cost and unpredictability of supply chains rise, particularly 
in regions prone to natural disasters.
The risk of power outages increases, especially during peak load 
periods;
a t the same time, the indirect consequences of climate change affect 
infrastructure and supply chains:
For example, the declining level of the Caspian Sea has impacted the 
operation of coastal ports and intermodal connectivity, affecting logistics 
in western regions. Similarly, the large-scale floods of 2024 resulted 
in significant damage to road infrastructure and disrupted deliveries.
The direct impact of climate-related disasters on borrowers necessitates 
the Bank’s flexibility in working with affected clients. In 2024, in response 
to the large-scale floods, the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 
Regulation and Development of the Financial Market (ARDFM), following 
the instruction of the Head of State, issued recommendations to second-
tier banks to support affected clients. Based on these regulatory 
recommendations, Halyk Bank granted loan restructurings to borrowers 
located in disaster areas, based on individual applications. It is important 
to note that these restructurings, stemming from external natural events, 
were not classified as distressed and were not subject to impairment 
procedures.
Understanding the systemic nature of climate threats has become 
a critical element of risk management. Halyk Bank continues to enhance 
climate-sensitive risk assessment methods, including the adaptation 
of stress testing models, expanding climate vulnerability analysis 
of borrowers, and integrating climate-related factors into credit decision-
making processes, particularly in climate-sensitive sectors and regions.
These include changes in public policy, tightening of regulations, 
the introduction of carbon pricing, and the transformation of market 
conditions, all of which pose potential challenges to businesses, 
particularly those operating in carbon-intensive sectors.
Halyk Bank recognises the nature and scale of these risks and 
is actively taking measures to support the low-carbon transition, 
in particular by financing projects in the field of renewable energy 
(wind power) that fall under the “Green t axonomy” category.

integration of Climate Risk Management Structure of the l oan portfolio in Carbon-
intensive Sectors
since the fourth quarter of 2023, the bank has implementeD esg risk assessment 
processes, incluDing the assignment of esg ratings to borrowers operating in high-
emission sectors such as mining, metallurgy , energy , anD oil anD gas. aDDitionall y , 
an esg sector segmentation methoDology has been DevelopeD , enabling the 
classification of borrowers by their exposure to sustainability-relateD risks. 
in 2024, the scope of assessment was expanDeD to cover all sectors of the economy .
as part of its focus on sustainability anD climate-relateD risks, hal yk bank conDucts 
regular anal yses of the loan portfolio structure by carbon-intensive sectors, 
taking into account the business profiles of borrowers. 
The Bank is implementing a Responsible Financing 
Policy, which prioritises the consideration of social and 
environmental aspects in decision-making processes. 
Calculations are based on the Bank’s internal 
sectoral methodology, whereby the primary sector 
is defined as the one generating the majority 
of a borrower’s revenue and supporting the 
fulfilment of obligations to the Bank.
Thus, climate risks are regarded as an integral 
component of the Bank’s overall risk management 
system and are directly linked to the achievement 
of its strategic sustainable development goals.
A key aspect of further advancing the climate 
risk management system will be the introduction 
of climate stress testing in line with leading 
international practices. The Bank plans to develop 
a s part of this policy: a s of the end of 2024:based on the outcomes of the climate stress 
testing, the bank intends to:
Activities and practices that are inconsistent 
with the principles of responsible finance are 
excluded.
Develop new methodologies for 
risk management, including the adaptation 
of comprehensive credit risk tools 
incorporating climate scenarios.
Potential impacts on society and the 
environment are evaluated; These sectors accounted for 32% of the 
overall corporate loan portfolio.
Ensure alignment with the Principles for Effective 
Management and Supervision of Climate-
related Financial Risks established by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision;
Risk assessments are conducted at both the 
sectoral and project levels;
The total volume of loans to carbon-intensive 
sectors in corporate banking increased 
by 72%, or KZT 814.67 billion;
Set objectives for integrating climate risks into 
the existing risk management framework;
scenario-based assessments covering both 
physical and transition climate risks to evaluate their 
impact on financial resilience.
These measures aim to ensure the long-term 
resilience of the loan portfolio, increase the 
adaptability of the business model to low-carbon 
development requirements, and minimise risks arising 
from global market and regulatory transformations.
During the reporting period, there was an increase 
in financing across key sectors of the extractive, 
processing, and energy industries. The majority 
of funds were directed towards the development 
of the metallurgical sector – primarily for projects 
related to copper mining and processing (17% within 
this sector, or 16% of all carbon-intensive industries), 
as well as the gold mining industry (56% or 52% 
of the total growth across all sectors).
Financing of the gold mining industry plays 
an important role in the economy at both national 
and international levels, supporting the stability 
of foreign exchange and gold reserves, stimulating 
trade, and providing investment opportunities – 
thereby strengthening countries’ financial resilience. 
Copper, in turn, is regarded as a critical metal for 
renewable energy, electric transport, and digital 
infrastructure, and is considered the key metal of the 
green energy transition.
Although the uranium industry received 
relatively modest investment volumes, it remains 
significant: current projects lay the groundwork for 
future stages of the nuclear fuel cycle and support 
long-term energy security.
Particular attention is given to the oil and gas 
sector, where investment growth is largely driven 
by the implementation of a major gas processing 
project. As a transitional fuel, gas plays a vital role 
in maintaining the energy balance amid the ongoing 
sustainable energy transition.
Overall, more than 70% of the portfolio growth 
in the metallurgical industry was driven by financing 
of these specified projects, highlighting the 
strategic importance of these sectors for national 
development and sustainable growth.

key changes in sectoral composition:
Metallurgical and Metalworking industry
The production of metals, especially steel, requires a large amount of energy, which is generated by burning 
fossil fuels, leading to carbon dioxide emissions.
The main growth was recorded in this sector – 512.76 billion tenge, which is associated with the financing 
of new clients and an increase in financing limits for existing borrowers in the area of metallurgical 
products manufacturing and processing. In addition, 220 billion tenge was allocated to finance large-scale 
projects specializing in mining, particularly of precious metals.

t o anal yse the loan portfolio structure by carbon-intensive sectors, the bank 
applies an internal methoDology for classifying the Debt of sme anD corporate 
borrowers by sector. 
this approach ensures transparency anD reproDucibility in the segmentation of the 
creDit portfolio, while also enabling the bank to more effectivel y assess climate-
relateD risks anD the environmental impact of its portfolio lenDing.
the segmentation procedure includes the following steps:
okeD interpretation: Values in the “OKED” field are converted into textual descriptions using the Bank’s 
internal directory, allowing precise identification of business activities;
Debt aggregation: Borrowers engaged in carbon-intensive activities are selected based on the textual 
OKED descriptions and the Bank’s carbon intensity criteria. The total debt of these borrowers is then 
aggregated for each relevant sector;
Maturity breakdown: Data are ranked by loan maturity to reflect the portfolio’s temporal structure and 
allow analysis of time-based credit risk exposure to carbon-intensive sectors.
Sectoral filtering: Records are sequentially filtered by the “Industry (MCR)” column to identify borrowers 
belonging to each defined sector;
Classification by primary sector: Each borrower entry is matched to one of 21 main sectors listed in the 
Bank’s internal directory, enabling a standardised approach to sector classification;

Halyk Bank views human capital as one of its 
key competitive advantages and a strategic 
resource for achieving sustainable 
development. In the context of high competition 
in the labour market, the Bank actively 
implements innovative recruitment methods 
aimed at attracting, retaining, and developing 
talented professionals.
The Bank strives to ensure equal access 
to career opportunities for applicants with 
diverse experience, education, age, gender, and 
regional backgrounds. We implement initiatives 
aimed at attracting talent from various social 
and demographic groups, including university 
graduates, young professionals, regional 
candidates, and representatives of socially 
vulnerable categories. This approach fosters 
an inclusive corporate culture and contributes 
to the sustainable development of the Bank’s team.
In 2024, special attention was given 
to automation and digital transformation 
in recruitment processes:
 f Interview scheduling was optimised through 
RPA technologies;
 f Automatic vacancy posting was introduced 
across internal and external platforms;
 f Candidate communication via WhatsApp was 
automated, speeding up response times;
 f Robotic process automation (RPA) was scaled 
to regional branches, unifying processes and 
reducing routine tasks;
 f A recruitment monitoring dashboard was 
introduced, enabling real-time visibility across all 
stages of the hiring process.
 
The Bank also employs modern candidate 
assessment techniques that allow for automated 
profile evaluations.
A key priority in 2024 was increasing the 
proportion of internal appointments. Through 
strategic planning and effective implementation 
of talent pool development programmes, 60% 
of vacancies were filled internally, including 
graduates of the HalykStart trainee programme 
in IT specialisations.
Social and innovative HR projects were also 
implemented, including the Halyk Bolashagy 
career guidance programme for employees’ 
children.
To ensure the successful integration of new 
employees into the corporate environment, 
Halyk Bank operates a systematic onboarding 
programme covering both organisational 
and behavioural aspects of team integration. 
The onboarding process is based on a mentoring 
approach–new hires receive support 
from mentors and line managers, undergo 
training, and become familiar with corporate 
standards.
This onboarding framework not only helps 
staff quickly adapt to work processes but also 
promotes engagement with the corporate 
culture. After completing the induction phase, 
employees proceed to more in-depth training and 
personalised development planning.
This systematic approach to recruitment and 
onboarding allows the Bank to maintain a stable 
staffing level, minimise employee turnover, 
and build a strong team capable of effectively 
delivering on strategic goals.
t o strengthen its employer brand, the bank 
implemented a range of communications 
initiatives:

Nudgeathon (behavioural economics, 
KBTU),
Nomad Game Jam (gamification, 
KazNTU),
GitHub Copilot AI Hackathon, aimed 
at advancing AI skills and engineering 
culture.
In 2024, the Bank hired 2,723 people, amounting to 19% 
of the average headcount. Of these, women accounted for 
40% and men for 60%. In terms of age structure, the majority 
of new hires (65%) were under 30 years old, with 32% in the 
30–50 age group and 3% over 50.

Halyk Academy programme in support of the younger 
generation. In 2024, Al-Farabi Kazakh National 
University joined our partner universities – KBTU, 
IITU, SDU, and Satbayev University. At the Faculty 
of Information Technology, a multifunctional Halyk 
laboratory and coworking space were opened. 
Halyk Academy will enable KazNU students not only 
to access the latest technologies and opportunities 
to explore the IT field, but also to attend lectures 
delivered by specialists from Halyk’s IT departments, 
with the possibility of further internships at the 
Bank. In 2024, a coworking space was also opened 
at AlmaU, which became the Bank’s first non-technical 
university partner. This new creative space allows 
students to discuss innovative projects and engage 
in creative work.
These initiatives highlight our commitment 
to enhancing the educational process and investing 
in the future. In 2024, we continued to encourage Bank 
employees to deliver lectures at partner universities 
and contribute to the training of future colleagues.
By further developing the project, we are providing 
students from partner universities with the opportunity 
to engage directly with real business challenges. This 
allows our colleagues to build their teaching skills, 
while we continue to attract the most promising 
students to the Bank.
The results of our youth engagement efforts include 
a growing number of interns transitioning into 
permanent roles at the Bank. In 2024, approximately 
80% of interns were offered new positions within the 
Bank’s staff.

The Bank annually participates in market salary surveys 
to ensure the competitiveness and transparency 
of its remuneration system. Salaries are regularly 
indexed, and annual bonuses as well as a premium for 
Kazakhstan’s Independence Day are paid.
In May 2024, an indexation was carried out, resulting 
in the following:
 f average salary increase of 15% across all employees;
 f increases of up to 20% for certain categories 
of employees, including tellers, drivers, building 
supervisors, cleaners, and other lower-salaried roles.
 
The Bank also continued the implementation of its 
variable pay project based on key performance 
indicators (KPIs). In 2024:
 f over 9,000 employees across 10 business lines 
were covered by the KPI-based bonus system;
 f the project was enhanced with data visualisation 
and personalised data export features, improving 
both transparency and motivational impact;
 f the system now covers approximately 40 business 
roles and enables each employee to track their 
progress and understand the link between 
performance and reward.
 
In 2024, the General Meeting of Shareholders 
approved the long-term employee and Board 
of Directors incentive plan involving the use of Bank 
shares, in line with best international corporate 
governance practices.
The implementation of a share placement 
(realisation) programme for employees and members 
of the Board of Directors of Halyk Bank JSC, without 
pre-emptive rights, as a form of remuneration or 
incentive, is intended to foster a stronger sense 
of belonging and engagement. It also serves 
as a powerful tool for attracting, retaining, and 
rewarding key talent, with a positive impact on the 
Bank’s financial performance and corporate culture.
Halyk Bank continues to develop robust employee 
feedback mechanisms. In 2024, the Bank maintained 
its global engagement survey, assessing key aspects 
of employee satisfaction such as working conditions, 
remuneration system, and opportunities for learn-
ing and career development. The engagement level 
reached 85% by the end of the year.
Internal customer satisfaction is assessed quarterly, 
helping to analyse interdepartmental cooperation and 
improve team efficiency.
Multiple communication channels are available for 
employees, including a confidential helpline, corporate 
email, and an online feedback platform on the Bank’s 
website.
The Bank is committed to ensuring pay equity, 
adhering to principles of sustainable development 
and social responsibility. A grading system based 
on the Hay Group methodology is in place, whereby 
remuneration levels are determined by job grade and 
are independent of gender. The average monthly 
remuneration of women, by grade, stands 
at approximately 97% of that of men, while the ratio 
of women’s variable remuneration (bonuses) to that 
of men is 116%.

To support career advancement and identify talent, 
the HiPRO programme was launched in 2024–a 
system for evaluating and mentoring high-potential 
employees. Selection is based on a combination 
of professional and behavioural competencies, 
including:
 f successful project outcomes;
 f business result orientation;
 f expertise and task execution quality;
 f proactivity and initiative.
 
Evaluation is conducted by colleagues from 
independent units, ensuring a comprehensive and 
objective approach. The programme strengthens 
the Bank’s talent pipeline and supports targeted 
professional development.
A key factor in strengthening engagement 
and motivation in 2024 was the development 
of cross-functional teams (tribes). These teams 
have evolved into resilient platforms for knowledge 
sharing, ideation, and rapid implementation 
of innovative solutions. Notably, the new “Data 
Factory” tribe was launched in the retail business, 
with a focus on enhancing customer experience 
through data analytics.
Halyk Bank actively promotes mentorship 
as a core tool for professional development and 
a key element of its internal learning culture. 
In line with the Bank’s Code of Ethics and Business 
Conduct, employee development is encouraged 
through various means, including mentoring, 
and managers are expected to play an active role 
in talent development, coaching, and knowledge 
transfer.
Each new hire is assigned a mentor from the 
relevant department for the first three months 
of employment, ensuring team integration, 
professional onboarding, and skill development. 
At the end of this period, a two-way evaluation 
Caring for employees’ physical and emotional 
well-being is one of Halyk Bank’s key motivational 
priorities. In 2024, the Bank continued to expand 
its multifunctional well-being programme with several 
new initiatives, including:
 f free psychological counselling services for the 
second consecutive year;
 f Mental Health Weeks featuring yoga, tai chi, 
psychology lectures, and film screenings with 
follow-up discussions.
 
These initiatives not only reduce stress and improve 
resilience, but also foster a culture of open dialogue 
and care within the workplace.

In 2024, the Bank enhanced its annual Recognition 
Programme, which includes:
 f awarding of certificates, trophies, and monetary 
bonuses;
 f additional incentives such as gift boxes with 
branded merchandise for first- and second-place 
winners;
 f international travel for first-place winners through 
the Halyk Travel service.
 
New emphasis was placed on the “Quarterly 
Recognition of Best Bank Employees” competition, 
aimed at identifying and rewarding outstanding 
professionals. A key feature of the programme 
is its transparent two-round open voting process, 
which excludes managerial involvement enhancing 
transparency and engagement.
New nomination categories were introduced in the 
Annual Recognition Programme in 2024:
 f “Best Branch HR Director”;
 f “Best Branch Director for Quality Indicators” .
 
The programme fosters a strong recognition culture, 
promotes fair evaluation, and supports the adoption 
of best HR management practices.
In addition to corporate awards, Bank employees 
and managers received high-profile industry honours 
in 2024, including:
 f the “Merey” Order;
 f the title of “Honoured Financier”;
 f the “Best Financier” Medal;
 f the Medal commemorating the 25th anniversary of AFK;
 f letters of appreciation from the Agency

is conducted: the mentor assesses the employee’s 
adaptation progress, and the employee evaluates the 
quality of mentoring received.
Additionally, at the beginning of 2025, a  dedicated men-
torship programme was launched within the IT de-
partment to foster a structured knowledge-sharing 
process and build internal expertise communities. We 
regard mentoring as an integral part of a sustainable 
people strategy, supporting knowledge retention within 
the organisation, enhancing engagement, and fostering 
the team’s professional growth.

Internal initiatives continued to evolve and included:
 f “Book Exchange” corners in office spaces;
 f a “Tree” installation was set up in the main 
office lobby to improve the work environment, 
create an uplifting atmosphere, and boost 
employee morale.
 f The installation changes its design and theme 
based on the season, holidays, or corporate events;
 f launch of a new centralised HR mailbox for 
employee communications;
 f creation of employee interest groups (hiking, 
environmental activities).
 
In 2024, particular attention was given to organising 
workshops for senior managers on relevant and 
high-impact topics, with a special focus on artificial 
intelligence (AI). These workshops, led by our 
Information Technology division, enabled employees 
to gain a deeper understanding of the potential and 
challenges associated with the adoption of emerging 
technologies. The sessions became an integral 
part of the professional development programme 
and contributed to strengthening leadership 
competencies and facilitating knowledge exchange 
among participants.

Halyk Bank supports the formation of informal 
interest-based employee communities built around 
shared hobbies and values. These include hiking 
clubs, environmental initiatives, and language clubs. 
Originating from employees themselves, these 
communities are supported by the HR department and 
help foster team spirit, horizontal connections, and 
an inclusive workplace culture.
The Bank deliberately maintains a flexible and organic 
approach to these initiatives, without imposing formal 
registration requirements, which ensures high levels 
of employee engagement and autonomy. Going 
forward, Halyk Bank will continue to facilitate the 
growth of such self-organised communities as part 
of its human-centred corporate environment.
In 2024, Halyk Bank employees demonstrated strong 
solidarity in response to the most severe flood in the 
past 80 years. Staff voluntarily donated a day’s 
pay to aid victims, raising KZT 200 million, which 
the Bank matched, bringing the total contribution 
to KZT 450 million.
Throughout the year, numerous social initiatives 
reflected the Bank’s culture of responsibility 
and mutual support, including:
 f participation in the “Wishing Tree” campaign – 
employees prepared gifts for children from low-
income families;
 f charitable visits to orphanages and support for 
Bank retirees;
 f over KZT 5.9 million raised by the Head Office 
to support oncology centres, orphanages, and 
families in crisis;
 f participation in environmental initiatives – tree 
planting, clean-up days, and office cleaning 
for World Cleanup Day;
 f environmental literacy trainings and ESG awareness 
activities for employees.
Thus, Halyk Bank’s employee motivation and 
engagement system is built on principles of respect, 
development, recognition, and care. It not only 
supports high performance but also lays a solid 
foundation for long-term sustainability and internal 
trust.
CoRpoRate CultuRe DevelopMent
A steady increase in key engagement metrics over 
the past three years reflects the effectiveness of the 
Bank’s corporate culture initiatives.
Activities designed to strengthen this culture 
included:
 f summer corporate events, team-building activities, 
and sports tournaments (table tennis, mini-football, 
chess);
 f themed quizzes and intellectual games covering 
business, cultural, and financial topics;
 f lectures by external experts (art, literature, finance), 
actively supported by branches;
 f the “Induction Ceremony” for employees reaching 
one year of service;
 f promotion of Bank digital services, including 
recognition of top Halyk Super App users.
 
Additionally а corporate movie screening was also 
held for Bank leaders at the Halyk IMAX Kinopark 16 
cinema, helping to strengthen informal relationships 
and becoming a regular feature of the Bank’s internal 
communications calendar.

1. Job evaluation, which determines the position’s 
importance to the organisation and the extent 
to which performance affects the Bank’s overall 
efficiency;
2. Analysis of compensation levels for comparable 
positions in the regional labour market;
3. Assessment of individual performance, which 
is applied in the annual bonus system.
 
With regard to the remuneration of members of the 
Board of Directors, the key principles are alignment 
of remuneration levels with individual qualifications 
and contributions to the Bank’s performance, as well 
as the conscientious fulfilment of their duties and 
the successful achievement of objectives aligned 
with the interests of the Bank and its shareholders.
ConfliC t of inteRe St
matters relateD to conflict of interest are governeD by the bank’s conflict 
of interest management policy , as well as its coDe of ethics anD business conDuct . 
these instruments support the maintenance of a high stanD arD of corporate 
culture anD the making of objective management Decisions.
There are no conflicts of interest within the 
composition of the Board that could affect its 
effectiveness. All members of the Board of Directors 
are committed to the coordinated and result-
oriented work of the collegial governing body.

In 2024, the implementation of ESG initiatives and other key aspects 
of corporate governance were actively discussed at regular meetings 
of the Board of Directors, enabling timely corrective action where 
necessary. In particular, the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the 
Bank’s ESG Strategy for 2025–2027 and also reviewed progress reports 
on the implementation of the Action Plan for the adoption of sustainable 
development principles and goals for 2022–2024. In this way, the Bank’s 
highest governing bodies regularly monitor the Bank’s progress in this area. 
The Board of Directors also reviewed the Bank’s 2023 Sustainability Report, 
aimed at systematically disclosing sustainability-related activities in line with 
best international practices and enhancing transparency for stakeholders.
The Bank’s ESG management is carried out by the Board of Directors 
through the work of dedicated committees: the Strategic Planning 
Committee, the Sustainable Development Committee, and the Risk 
Committee.
The Strategic Planning Committee oversees sustainable development 
strategy matters, defines goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) 
in the field of sustainability, and analyses the execution of the strategic plan, 
taking into account external environmental impacts.
The Sustainable Development Committee facilitates the integration 
of sustainability and ESG principles into the Bank’s operations, and 
reviews reports on the implementation of relevant activities and initiatives 
in sponsorship and charitable work.
The Risk Committee ensures the incorporation of ESG risks into the 
Bank’s credit and investment policy and oversees climate risk assessment 
processes, including scenario analysis and stress testing.
The Bank’s Management Board is responsible for developing and approving 
the ESG and Sustainability Action Plan, as well as for the operational 
oversight of its implementation by the Bank’s structural units.
The Credit Committee (Commercial Directorate, Branch Network Credit 
Committee, Branch Credit Committee, Decision-Making Centre for SME 
Lending) is a collegial body of the Bank authorised to make decisions on the 
financing and/or refinancing of Eligible Projects
13 using proceeds from 
green financial instruments.
The Bank’s dedicated structural unit responsible for implementing ESG 
initiatives serves as the main coordinating body, introducing a systematic 
approach to ESG and sustainability management. It oversees the 
implementation of the action plan in line with corporate standards, 
provides expert support to other units on ESG matters, and is responsible 
for monitoring and reporting in this area.
The Risk Management Service coordinates the ESG risk management process, 
and develops and submits proposals for identifying and assessing ESG risks.
Independent structural units involved in the ESG agenda are responsible 
for the Bank’s business lines. They implement thematic ESG initiatives and 
provide targeted support to their respective audiences.
The Bank’s branches and subsidiaries involved in the ESG agenda provide 
regional support and implement regional ESG initiatives, including pilot projects.
13 An Eligible Project is a green project that is financed and/or refinanced using proceeds from green financial instruments and is aimed at improving the efficiency of existing natural resource use, reducing negative environmental impacts, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and 
contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Bank classifies eligible projects according to the categories of green projects outlined in the annex to the Green Finance Framework of JSC Halyk Bank.

The Bank consistently implements a zero-tolerance 
policy towards corruption, guided by the Anti-
Corruption Policy approved by the Board of Directors. 
This Policy sets out key requirements for 
compliance with anti-corruption legislation and 
provides mechanisms for controlling and preventing 
corruption risks.
The Policy includes specific guidelines on acceptable 
conduct for all employees. In particular:
 f the giving and receiving of bribes in any form 
(including through third parties) is strictly 
prohibited;
 f facilitation payments – any payments made 
to expedite administrative procedures–are not 
permitted;
 f restrictions are in place regarding gifts and 
representation expenses, including a ban on cash 
gifts and a mandatory review for potential conflicts 
of interest;
 f any contributions to political or religious 
organisations on behalf of the Bank are prohibited;
 f charitable activities are permitted only if they are 
transparent and free from conflicts of interest.
 
As part of the Anti-Corruption Policy, a three-level 
protection system has been implemented, ensuring 
effective day-to-day management of corruption risks, 
independent oversight, and regular audits conducted 
by the internal audit service.
Systematic work is carried out on an ongoing basis 
to monitor corruption risks, including due diligence 
of counterparties, control over compliance with 
procurement procedures, and the identification 
of potential conflicts of interest. This contributes to the 
development of a strong corporate culture of zero 
tolerance for corruption at all levels of the Bank’s 
governance.
In 2024, the Bank continued to implement 
a comprehensive approach to anti-corruption, placing 
particular emphasis on staff training, strengthening 
internal controls, and raising awareness of related 
risks.
Through the distance learning system, over 10,000 
employees completed the Anti-Corruption Policy 
training course, with 99% successfully passing the 
course. Every new employee undergoes mandatory 
anti-corruption induction training upon hiring. 
In addition, specialised workshops were organised for 
the heads of branch security services to enhance their 
skills in identifying and mitigating corruption risks.
To ensure transparency and strengthen oversight 
of corruption risks, the Bank submits an annual report 
to the Board of Directors on the implementation 
of anti-corruption measures.
In 2024, no incidents of corruption-related violations 
were recorded at the Bank.
The Bank unequivocally condemns money 
laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML/
CFT) and implements a comprehensive set 
of measures aimed at preventing the use of its 
services, products, and operations for unlawful 
purposes.
The Bank has implemented an internal control and 
risk management system for AML/CFT , developed 
in accordance with the legislation of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan, international FATF standards, 
the Wolfsberg Principles, and the recommendations 
of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 
This system covers all levels of the Bank’s 
operations and extends to its branches, subsidiaries, 
and affiliated entities.
Key elements of the Bank’s AML/CFT system 
include:
 f application of a risk-based approach to the 
assessment and management of AML/CFT risks;
 f mandatory customer due diligence and 
verification of beneficial ownership;
 f enhanced due diligence in cases of elevated risk, 
including identification of the source of funds;
JSC Halyk Bank’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy
 f monitoring of client transactions, including the 
detection and analysis of suspicious activity;
 f compliance with international sanctions, 
including UN, EU, and OFAC sanctions lists;
 f refusal to establish business relationships with 
shell companies, shell banks, and organisations 
that fail to observe AML/CFT measures;
 f regular updating of customer information;
 f reporting to authorised bodies in accordance 
with applicable legislation;
 f regular training of Bank employees on AML/
CFT matters;
 f implementation of comprehensive internal 
control programmes and assessment of their 
effectiveness.
 
All AML/CFT activities are coordinated 
by an independent compliance control unit, whose 
operations are separated from both operational and 
audit functions. This ensures independence and 
objectivity in monitoring compliance with legislation 
and the Bank’s internal regulations in this area.
The Bank’s commitment to the principles of legality, 
transparency, and zero tolerance for unlawful 
activities is an integral part of its corporate culture.

Risk Management and internal Control System
the bank builds its risk management and internal control system based on the three lines of defence model, ensuring independence, 
comprehensiveness, and a systematic approach to the oversight of all types of risks, including resilience to external challenges and climate-related risks. 
The Board of Directors provides strategic oversight 
of risk management and internal control matters. At the Board level, 
the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee act as its working 
bodies in the respective areas. The Board approves and regularly 
reviews risk management policies and examines major transactions, 
related-party transactions, and operations with affiliates to ensure 
they comply with market conditions and do not involve preferential 
treatment.
The Bank’s structural units are responsible for the initial identification 
and assessment of risks specific to their activities, as well 
as for monitoring the effectiveness of applied control mechanisms 
and ensuring business continuity.
The Internal Audit Service conducts an independent assessment 
of the effectiveness of the Bank’s risk management, internal control, 
and corporate governance systems. Its activities aim to ensure that 
the Bank’s practices comply with legal requirements, internal policies, 
and sustainability principles.
The Bank’s Management Board oversees the implementation 
of approved risk management policies and strategies. Operational 
risk management is carried out through specialised committees, 
including:
 f Head Office Credit Committee;
 f Branch Network Credit Committee;
 f Retail Credit Committee;
 f Problem Asset Committee;
 f Asset and Liability Management Committee;
 f Risk Committee.
Independent risk management and compliance functions 
ensure the operation of a system that covers the identification, 
assessment, monitoring, and control of credit, market, operational, 
compliance, and liquidity risks. These functions are headed by the 
Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer, respectively.

approach to Risk Management
RiSk appetite Mana GeMent CReDit RiSk Mana GeMentthe bank’s risk management 
policy is aimed at establishing 
a comprehensive and adaptive 
risk management system aligned 
with the scale, complexity, and 
profile of the risks undertaken. 
this system is designed not 
only to ensure compliance with 
regulatory requirements but 
also to support sustainable 
development and the bank’s 
strategic business objectives.
Amid a changing external environment, including 
growing sustainability requirements and 
climate-related challenges, the Bank continues 
to strengthen its risk management approach. 
Particular attention is given to enhancing early risk 
identification mechanisms, applying advanced 
assessment methods, and ensuring active oversight 
at all levels of management. This approach enables the 
Group to adapt promptly to change and increase its 
resilience to both internal and external challenges.
Halyk Bank adopts a systematic approach to risk 
appetite management, defining the acceptable level 
of material risks in line with the Group’s objectives 
and scale of operations. The risk appetite strategy 
establishes a framework for risk-taking, ensuring 
a balance between the execution of the business 
strategy and the Bank’s financial resilience.
The risk appetite strategy, approved by the Board 
of Directors, sets out key management principles 
and mechanisms, including procedures for 
setting, monitoring, and implementing risk appetite 
across all levels of the organisational structure.
Within this Strategy, quantitative limits are set for 
each material type of risk, reflecting the specifics 
of the business model, the scale of operations, and 
the risk profile. Compliance with the established 
limits is regularly monitored through the Bank’s 
risk management reporting system.
Halyk Bank has implemented a comprehensive credit 
risk management system that includes the regulation 
of business processes, institutional separation of sales 
and risk management functions, and an established 
organisational structure encompassing both collegial 
bodies and specialised departments.
Credit risk management is carried out through the 
following key mechanisms:
Within the Risk Appetite Strategy approved by the 
Board of Directors, quantitative limits have been 
set for the acceptable level of risk across key areas: 
credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk. These 
levels are aligned with the Bank’s business scale, 
operational specifics, and development model. 
Compliance with the established risk appetite 
is monitored on a regular basis through management 
reporting.
the bank’s credit decision-making system is based 
on delegated authority to collegial bodies, with credit 
limits established at each level. Specifically:
application of the three lines of defence model, 
including initial credit risk assessment 
by originating units, independent evaluation 
by the risk management function, and 
subsequent oversight by internal audit; for corporate borrowers, applications are 
reviewed by the Head Office Credit Committee 
(HOCC); if the proposed transaction exceeds its 
authority or involves related parties, decisions 
are made by the Board of Directors;
establishment of counterparty limits based 
on the type of transactions and products;
for small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs), decisions are made by the SME 
Decision-Making Centre (DMC), Branch Credit 
Committees (BCC), and the Branch Network 
Credit Committee (BNCC);
portfolio diversification by borrowers, sectors, 
and regions to mitigate concentration risks;
for the retail segment, decisions are made 
by the DMC and the Retail Credit Committee 
(RCC).

a focus on early identification of signs

aSSet anD liability Mana GeMent MaRket RiSk Mana GeMent
In 2024, the Bank continued to implement a balanced 
approach to asset and liability management, focusing 
on an optimal risk–return ratio. The Group’s assets 
primarily consisted of the loan portfolio (61.8%), 
the securities portfolio (24.3%), and cash and cash 
equivalents (7.9%). Annual asset growth amounted 
to 19.7%, driven by an increase in both the loan 
portfolio and the securities portfolio.
Liquidity management is supported by a diversified 
liability structure, based primarily on customer funds, 
which accounted for 83.9% at the end of 2024. 
Halyk Bank maintains a leading position in the 
funding market, with a 28.6% share of retail deposits 
and a 31.0% share of corporate deposits.
Counterparty monitoring is conducted 
on an ongoing basis, with prompt adjustment of limits 
to mitigate market and credit risks.
The Bank maintains a conservative approach 
to market risk management, sustaining neutral foreign 
exchange positions and monitoring interest rate and 
price risks. In 2024, the share of assets denominated 
in KZT increased to 70.3%, while the share of deposits 
in KZT rose to 69.1%. Interest rate risk remains under 
control due to a balanced structure of assets and 
liabilities and a system of internal limits.
Amid an increase in the base rate to 15.25% 
in response to inflationary risks, the Bank ensured the 
stability of its interest margin and alignment with its 
risk appetite.
Ongoing monitoring and flexible limit adjustments 
enable timely responses to market changes and 
help mitigate potential losses.
Lending to individuals is also carried out using 
automated underwriting, which includes checks 
against internal and external databases, credit scoring, 
and risk-based pricing. This approach enables 
the formulation of both personalised credit offers 
and alternative solutions, taking into account the 
borrower’s risk profile (such as participation in payroll 
projects, pensioner status, etc.).
For standard SME credit applications, a digital 
decision-making process is in place, using both 
internal and external data. Risk models assess 
creditworthiness, repayment capacity, credit limits, 
and interest rates. Digital credit products (DCPs) are 
offered online through an automated process.
The credit committees of the Bank’s subsidiary 
banks are also granted specific decision-making 
authorities. The Bank regularly monitors their activities 
and, when necessary, reviews credit limits and the 
authority matrix–particularly in cases of covenant 
breaches or changes in the macroeconomic 
environment.
The automated approach to credit decision-making 
complements the work of the DMC and RCC, ensuring 
efficiency and alignment with clients’ risk profiles. 
This approach takes into account the characteristics 
of borrowers and is aimed at minimising risks in mass 
retail lending.
In 2024, to assess the resilience of its loan portfolio, 
the Bank conducted a series of stress tests based 
on adverse macroeconomic scenarios, including 
a slowdown in global economic growth, inflationary 
pressures, a decline in oil prices, and rising geopolitical 
risks. The results confirmed the Bank’s capital 
resilience to asset quality deterioration.
t o improve the accuracy 
of assessments and align with 
the actual default rate, the 
bank applies its internal risk 
rate rating model to estimate 
the probability of default for 
corporate and medium-sized 
clients. this model serves 
as a tool for sectoral analysis, 
clearer differentiation of clients 
by creditworthiness, credit 
portfolio risk analysis, stress 
testing, and impairment 
assessment. in 2024, 
the model was recalibrated 
based on an extensive data 
analysis, and the updated version 
was successfully implemented 
into the system as of 1 january 
2025.

The Bank employs a comprehensive approach 
to operational risk management aimed at preventing 
losses caused by failures in internal processes, 
IT systems, human error, or external events. 
Key management tools include the ORAP system, 
control of new products and processes, incident 
collection and analysis in line with Basel standards, 
and the use of key risk indicators. In addition, scenario 
analysis and risk self-assessment are applied. 
The system is designed to enable early identification 
of threats and to minimise potential financial and 
reputational losses.
In 2024, the Bank continued to enhance its IT risk and 
information security management system, ensuring 
the resilience of its IT infrastructure and the protection 
of client data. The risk management approach 
was updated, and cyber threat monitoring was 
strengthened. In addition, the list of critical information 
assets is reviewed annually, and key risk indicators 
are regularly updated. Measures are taken to prevent 
fraud and unauthorised access. Modern monitoring 
technologies and a comprehensive approach help 
reduce vulnerabilities and maintain a high level of client 
trust.
The Bank conducts prudent capital management 
to ensure resilience and compliance with capital 
adequacy requirements in line with regulatory 
standards and Basel III principles. As part of the 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP), all material risks and strategic objectives are 
taken into account. In 2023, the Bank implemented 
a methodology for calculating internal (economic) 
capital, covering credit, market, and operational risks. 
The mechanisms in place enable the Bank to maintain 
financial stability and adapt promptly to changes in the 
external environment.
The Bank ensures the resilience of its business 
processes through a comprehensive business 
continuity management system that includes 
regulatory documents, infrastructure, trained 
personnel, and other components. A hybrid format 
has been introduced, allowing key employees to work 
remotely. An incident notification and response system 
is in place. Since 2023, regular online training has been 
conducted to prepare employees for crisis situations. 
These measures help to reduce operational risks and 
ensure preparedness for emergencies.

perioD from 1 j anuary to 31 December 2024. 
financial D ata is presenteD baseD on the 
group’s auDiteD consoliD ateD financial 
statements prepareD in accorD ance with 
ifrs , unless otherwise stateD in the text .
In preparing this Report, the Group has taken into 
account the requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) and the London 
Stock Exchange, as well as the recommendations 
of the Agency for Regulation and Development 
of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
regarding ESG disclosure. The Report includes 
indicators that contribute to the achievement of the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) relevant to the Group’s 2022–2024 strategy.
The reporting boundaries include all legal entities 
within the scope of the Halyk Group’s consolidated 
financial reporting. There are no material deviations 
between the scope of financial and non-financial 
reporting. Information on the Group’s subsidiaries 
is disclosed in the Annual Report (https://halykbank.
kz/about/shareholders_investors/investoram).
The Report is prepared on an annual basis and 
is published concurrently with the annual financial 
statements. The previous report for 2023 was 
released in July 2024.
A limited assurance review of key non-financial 
indicators, including greenhouse gas emissions data, 
was conducted by an independent assurance provider. 
The assurance statement is presented in the relevant 
section of this Report.
In order to enhance transparency and accountability, 
and in line with international sustainability reporting 
standards, including GRI 3: Material Topics 2021, 
the Bank conducted a materiality assessment. This 
process is essential for identifying the key areas where 
our activities impact the economy, society, and the 
environment, and for ensuring that the disclosed 
information remains relevant and focused.
In accordance with the requirements of GRI 3: Material Topics 2021, the Bank applied a systematic approach 
to identifying material topics, which includes four key steps:
Material topics are those that reflect the most 
significant actual or potential impacts of the Bank, 
including impacts on human rights, and that are 
of greatest importance to stakeholders. These topics 
form the basis of this Report’s content and underpin 
the Bank’s overall sustainability management 
approach.
Step 1. understanding the context of the organisation’s activities
The Bank conducted a comprehensive analysis of its operational, industry, and regulatory context, including:
 f characteristics of the business model and types of activities;
 f geographic distribution of operations;
 f client and partner profile;
 f institutional commitments, including adherence to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the 
principles of the UN Global Compact;
 f compliance with international standards, including the UK Corporate Governance Code, as well as the listing 
requirements of KASE and the LSE.

Step 2. identification of actual and potential impacts
Step 3. assessment of the significance of impacts
Step 4. prioritisation of impacts and identification of material topics
T aking into account the results of the internal analysis and external context, the Bank identified both positive 
and negative impacts on the economy, society, and the environment. The main sources of information included:
 f ESG requests from investors and rating agencies;
 f review of media publications;
 f analysis of megatrends in the banking sector;
 f analysis of peer banks (benchmark analysis);
 f opinions of Bank management based on interviews.
 
To increase objectivity, a rating system was applied, including a percentage-based assessment of each 
source’s contribution.
Each potential topic was assessed according to two key criteria:
 f Economic, environmental, and social impact, including its scale, scope, and irreversibility;
 f The topic’s influence on stakeholders, particularly on their decisions and expectations.
At the final stage, the Bank grouped the identified impacts into topics and defined a materiality threshold 
for inclusion in the Report. The result was a materiality matrix covering 15 aspects across the economic, 
environmental, and social spheres, as well as banking sector specifics. This list was validated with input from 
experts and key stakeholders (including clients, employees, shareholders, and investors) through engagement 
channels such as surveys, hotlines, client feedback, and meetings.

Methodology for data collection, consolidation, and calculation
HuMan Re SouRCe S Mana GeMent enviRonMent oCCupational HealtH anD Safety
The employee turnover rate at the Bank and its 
Subsidiaries is calculated using the following formula:
tR = a / b × 100%,
Where:
a – the number of employees who voluntarily 
terminated their employment contract during the 
reporting period;
The following cases are excluded from the turnover 
calculation:
 f voluntary termination due to transfer 
to outsourcing;
 f transfer to the Bank’s subsidiaries;
 f retirement;
 f voluntary termination by an employee holding 
a stoker position;
 f voluntary termination by an employee holding 
an intern specialist position;
 f voluntary termination during the probationary 
period (within 3 months from the date of hire);
 
b – the average headcount of employees at the Bank 
and its Subsidiaries during the reporting period.
Water consumption volumes were determined using 
a calculation-based method, based on the ratio 
of total expenses for water supply and wastewater 
services to the applicable tariffs.
The calculations used data on total costs for water 
consumption and wastewater disposal services, 
as well as the corresponding tariffs for the two types 
of services.
The water consumption calculations used tariff rates 
derived from available internal sources, taking into 
account the specifics of local conditions. For the 
2024 calculations, the average annual tariff for each 
branch was applied, ensuring comparability with 
previous periods and taking into account current 
tariff characteristics without detailed seasonal 
adjustments.
To improve accuracy and standardisation, further 
development of the accounting system is planned, 
including a gradual transition to tracking physical 
volumes of consumption based on primary 
documentation, as well as the implementation 
of a unified methodology and control system at the 
head office level.
For the calculation of the Lost Time Injury Frequency 
Rate (LTIFR), the Bank applied the methodology set 
out in “GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety,” 
2018 edition.
The Bank used a factor of 1 million worked hours 
to accurately reflect the rate relative to the number 
of employees of the Bank and its subsidiary. 
The calculation formula is provided below:
ltifR = injuries / Hours Worked × 1,000,000.
The LTIFR for the Bank and Halyk Collection LLP was 
0.08
(А) . The number of work-related injuries resulting 
in lost time in 2024 was 2, and both occurred at Halyk 
Collection LLP .
Hours worked in 2024 totaled: 24,151,008
(А)  for the 
Bank, and 2,385,088 (А) 14  for Halyk Collection LLP . 
In 2024, no occupational accidents were recorded 
at the Bank, excluding the subsidiary.
Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated using 
up-to-date data on the distribution of electricity 
generation sources in the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
As part of the methodological improvement, 
emissions from electricity generated from renewable 
energy sources (RES) were excluded from the 
calculations, as they are considered to have zero 
greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the emission 
calculations for subsidiaries were performed 
using updated emission factors, which allowed for 
improved accuracy in the emissions assessment.
The calculation of indirect energy emissions 
(Scope 2) for Halyk Bank Georgia JSC and Tenge 
Bank JSC was carried out using international CO
2 
emission factors based on statistical data from the 
International Energy Agency (IEA). 
14 The total number of man-hours for the Bank is calculated 
using an estimated method, based on the assumption that 
employees (the actual headcount as of December 31, 2024) 
worked the standard number of working hours under a five-day 
workweek in 2024 (1,992 hours according to the Production 
Calendar, excluding vacations and sick leaves).
