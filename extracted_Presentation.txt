Disclaimer
Certain information contained in this presentation may include forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are not
guarantees of future performance. These statements are based on management’s current expectations or beliefs as of the date of this
presentation and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements. The Bank disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-
looking statements.
The alternative performance measures (“APMs”) disclosed in this presentation are unaudited supplementary measures of the Halyk
Group’s performance and liquidity that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. These measures are not defined by
IFRS and the Halyk Group’s use and definition of these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled APMs used by other companies
in the financial industry due to differences in accounting policies or differences in the calculation methodology. These APMs have
limitations and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for financial information as reported under IFRS. Accordingly, undue
reliance should not be placed on the APMs presented in this presentation. The Halyk Group has included these measures because it
believes that they enhance an investor’s understanding of the Halyk Group’s financial performance. The Halyk Group also believes that
these APMs are commonly used by investors in comparing the performance of businesses. The management of the
Halyk Group uses these measures to monitor and analyse Halyk Group’s performance.
Basis of calculation:
- all figures in this presentation are based on IFRS audited financial statements or financial statements reviewed by auditors, unless stated
otherwise;

➢ Interest income for 9M 2024 was up by 30.3% vs. 9M 2023 mainly due to increase in average
rate and balances of loans to customers.
➢ Interest expense for 9M 2024 increased by 27.9% vs. 9M 2023 mainly as a result of the
growth in average rate on amounts due to customers and growth in the share of KZT amounts
due to customers.
➢ In 9M 2024 net interest margin was affected by the increase in average rates on both loans
to customers and amounts due to customers. Furthermore, net interest margin was positively
impacted by the increase in the share of higher yielding retail loans in total loan portfolio and
share of loans to customers in total interest earning assets, as well as increase in the share of
KZT interest-earning cash and cash equivalents. As a result, net interest margin has grown to
7.1% p.a. for 9M 2024 compared to 6.3% p.a. for 9M 2023.

➢ Fee and commission income in 9M 2024 vs. 9M 2023 increased by 2.0%. It was negatively
impacted by base effect related to transition to amortization of tariff packages for legal entities
starting from November 2023. Moreover, there was a revision of some retail tariffs in 2H of 2023.
On top of that, the amount of bonuses for the loyalty program significantly grew due to increased
transactional activity of retail clients and growing share of QR payments.
➢ Fee and commission expense in 9M 2024 vs. 9M 2023 grew by 7.3% mainly due to increase in
service fees on payment cards and in deposit insurance fees payable to the Kazakhstan Deposit
Insurance Fund following the retail deposits amount growth. As a result, despite the growth of
clients’ transactional activity, the net fee and commission income for 9M 2024 decreased by 2.7%
vs. 9M 2023.
