## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be applied to solve a real
internal business problem using a product-oriented approach.

Instead of implementing AI for experimentation, the project applies:
- Product Operating Model principles
- Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) framework
- Governance and financial reasoning

The selected use case focuses on procurement and contract compliance processes.
